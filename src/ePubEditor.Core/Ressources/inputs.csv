"Unknown","Jay Ts & Robert Eckstein & David Collier-Brown","This book, which has been officially adopted by the Samba Team and is under the GNU Free Documentation License (FDL), is a comprehensive guide to Samba administration. The 2nd edition focuses on Samba 2.2 and covers the most important features of 3.0, which was under development as this book went to print. Samba is a cross-platform triumph: it turns a Unix or Linux system into a file and print server for Microsoft Windows network clients. Samba is so robust, flexible, fast, and secure that many people are choosing it over Windows NT/2000/XP for their file and print services. Samba is also free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License. This book will help you make file and print sharing as robust, powerful, and efficient as possible. The authors delve into the internals of the Windows activities and protocols to an unprecedented degree, explaining the strengths and weaknesses of each feature in Windows domains and in Samba itself. Using Samba takes you from basic installation and configuration--on both the client and server side, for a wide range of systems--to subtle details of security, cross-platform compatibility, and resource discovery that make the difference between whether a user sees the folder they expect or a cryptic error message. The range of this book knows few bounds. Wondering how to integrate Samba's authentication with that of a Windows PDC? How to get Samba to serve Microsoft Dfs shares? How to share files on Mac OS X? These and a dozen other issues of interest to system administrators are covered. A whole chapter is dedicated to troubleshooting. Whether you're playing on one note or a full three-octave range, on your personal computer or an enterprise network, Using Samba will give you an efficient and secure server.

"Zelazny, Roger","Roger Zelazny","SUMMARY: You've gotta love to hate the 1977 movie Damnation Alley, a cheese-filled classic from sci-fi's cinematic canon. But there's at least one good thing you can say about this otherwise awful flick: it's prevented the movie's far superior source material from being forgotten. Roger Zelazny's post-apocalypse novel predates the George Peppard-Jan-Michael Vincent vehicle by about a decade and represents the fine storytelling talents of one of science fiction and fantasy's most daring writers (likely best remembered for his imaginative Amber series). Speaking of vehicles: the coolest part of the movie--and likely, thankfully, the only part most people remember--turns out to be even cooler in the book: the flame-spewing, .50-caliber-bullet-belching, grenade-throwing, gigantic all-terrain vehicle that's responsible for getting a crucial antiserum shipment from Los Angeles to Boston to stop a deadly plague. The driver, a despicable lowlife named Hell Tanner, has been given a not-so-difficult choice. He can either get the drugs to the East Coast intact, save humanity, and receive a full pardon for his crimes, or he can refuse and spend the rest of his life in a ""zebra suit."" So what's the catch? Thanks to World War III, Middle America is now an electrical-storm-torn, heavily irradiated playground for dino-sized Gila monsters, ""freak spiders,"" humongous bats ""that eat off the mutie fruit trees down Mexico way,"" and 120-foot-long snakes as big around as garbage cans. And the native humans still scrambling around the wasteland aren't much less dangerous. Damnation Alley might not be Zelazny's best, but for reading on, say, a road trip, you can't do much better. Throw in some '60s-style, freak-out closing riffs, and a trip down the Alley becomes pretty hard to pass up. --Paul Hughes","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Roger Zelazny\Damnation Alley (936)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:39:41+02:00","epub","9780743486620","936","isbn:9780743486620","","Calibre Library","2004-02-24T02:00:00+02:00","I Books","3","","1.0","134567","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Classics, Criticism, Literature - Classics, Science fiction - gsafd","Damnation Alley","Damnation Alley","7f28000a-c50a-4c6b-b92a-4737f0a66bd1"

"Zahn, Timothy","Timothy Zahn","SUMMARY: Damon Lathe and his blackcollar combat team were sent to capture five hidden Nova-class warships from under the Ryqril conquerors' snouts. Against all odds they had succeeded , sharing their prize with the Terran Democratic Empire's erstwhile Chryselli allies, who were themselves the current focus of Ryqril aggression. Lathe had followed that by successfully entering Earth's last mountain war-era fortress and found a small resistance movement's final project: a drug called Whiplash, which could break the supposedly unbreakable Ryqril loyalty-conditioning. Now they face their most serious challenge. On one of the conquered human colony worlds is a Ryqril tactical center through which flows an entire sector's worth of military data. If the blackcollars can find a way inside, it could tip the balance in the current Ryqril-Chryselli war. It could even start humanity on the path back to ultimate freedom. But the Ryqril aren't sitting idly by. Under threat of reprisals against his world, Prefect Jamus Galway of Plinry is already on the case. His plan: to turn the blackcollars and their combat skill into unknowing tools of the Ryqril. His hidden ace: a clone duplicate of Lathe's ally Allan Caine, ready to be slipped into Lathe's inner circle. It will be the blackcollars' most important mission. It may also be their last.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Timothy Zahn\Blackcollar_ The Judas Solution (939)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:39:42+02:00","epub","9781416520658","939","isbn:9781416520658","","Calibre Library","2006-05-23T01:00:00+02:00","Baen","4","","1.0","310785","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Space Opera, Adventure, Science Fiction - Adventure, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Science Fiction - Space Opera, Science Fiction - Military","Blackcollar: The Judas Solution","Blackcollar: The Judas Solution","24a7307f-87be-4c7e-aaee-eb51a448bf58"
"Zahn, Timothy","Timothy Zahn","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  *Vision of the Future* is the second book in the epic two-volume series *The Hand of Thrawn* from Timothy Zahn, the bestselling, Hugo Award-winning author of the original landmark trilogy based on George Lucas's legendary Star Wars(r) films. Now the story begun in *Specter of the Past* comes to an explosive conclusion as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo are thrust into the middle of an impending civil war--and discover the shocking truth behind the rumored resurrection of the dead Admiral Thrawn.  For a beleaguered Empire, desperate times call for desperate measures. Sowing discord among the fragile coalition of the New Republic, remnants of the once powerful Empire make one last play for victory. Having implicated the Bothans in an act of genocide, they now plan an attack on Han and Leia that is also to be blamed on the Bothans. If they are successful, the New Republic will be torn asunder. To prevent inevitable disaster, Luke, Leia, Han, and their friends must prove the Bothans innocent and reveal the Empire's treachery. But time is running out.  The cunning Major Tierce has joined with the ambitious Moff Disra in the Empire's master plan. At its heart lies the most elaborate con of all: the rumor that the legendary Grand Admiral Thrawn, long believed dead, has returned to lead the Empire to a prophesied triumph. The news of Thrawn's return is already rallying Empire forces against the New Republic.  As Leia travels to a secret rendezvous with an Imperial commander who claims towant peace, Han and Lando Calrissian journey into enemy territory to learn the truth of Emberlene's destruction. Meanwhile, Luke and Mara Jade infiltrate a hidden fortress where Thrawn's most fanatical followers await his call to arms. And Talon Karrde returns to his underworld past and a brutal crime lord whose knowledge may save the Republic. But it is the truth about Thrawn that is most important. In his hands--alive or dead--rests the fate of the New Republic.  *Vision of the Future* is the magnificent finale to one of the most suspenseful, action-packed, and thought-provoking Star Wars(r) stories yet. It is a masterful re-creation that captures the magic and adventure of the greatest science fiction saga of all time.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Timothy Zahn\Vision of the future (940)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:39:42+02:00","epub","9780553100358","940","isbn:9780553100358","","Calibre Library","1998-09-01T01:00:00+02:00","New York : Bantam Books, 1998.","4","","1.0","530339","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Space Opera, Adventure, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Life on other planets, Skywalker; Luke (Fictitious character), Leia; Princess (Fictitious character), Star Wars fiction, Leia; Princess (Fictitious character) - Fiction, Leia; Princess (Fictitious cha, Solo; Han (Fictitious characte, Life on other planets - Fiction, Solo; Han (Fictitious character) - Fiction, Solo; Han (Fictitious character), Skywalker; Luke (Fictitious character) - Fiction, Skywalker; Luke (Fictitious ch","Vision of the future","Vision of the future","48f0d986-b1c3-46a0-9594-4d1e7f8b20fd"

"Winterson, Jeanette","Jeanette Winterson","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  *This new world weighs a yatto-gram.   But everything is trial-size; tread-on-me-tiny or blurred-out-offocus huge. There are leaves that have grown as big as cities, and there are birds that nest in cockleshells. On the white sand there are long-toed claw prints deep as nightmares, and there are rock pools in hand-hollows finned by invisible fish . . .   *Mankind has rendered its planet unlivable and is beginning to colonize a new blue planet. Our heroine Billie Crusoe’s flight to the future is also a return to the distant past—“Everything is imprinted forever with what once was.” What begins as a witty, satirical futurist adventure deepens into a dazzling exploration of our relationship to environment, to power and technology, and to what defines us as humans.   For over twenty years Jeanette Winterson has consistently been one of our most brilliant writers. Lyrical, visionary, by turns funny and devastating, *The Stone Gods *is fiction at its most provocative.

"Unknown","Richard Wiseman","<p>Why do some people lead happy successful lives whilst other face repeated failure and sadness?  Why do some find their perfect partner whilst others stagger from one broken relationship to the next?  What enables some people to have successful careers whilst others find themselves trapped in jobs they detest?  And can unlucky people do anything to improve their luck - and lives? Ten years ago, Professor Richard Wiseman decided to search for the elusive luck factor by investigating the actual beliefs and experiences of lucky and unlucky people.  The results reveal a radical new way of looking at luck.  In this book, Wiseman identifies the four simple behavioural techniques that have been scientifically proven to help you attract good fortune.  He then shows how you can use these methods to revolutionise every area of your life - including your relationships, personal finances and career.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Richard Wiseman\The Luck Factor (1059)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:40:39+02:00","epub","9781446440759","1059","isbn:9781446440759","eng","Calibre Library","0101-01-01T02:00:00+02:00","Random House","","","1.0","907313","","The Luck Factor","Luck Factor, The","a104a717-0b5a-47b1-b0f7-78a985438e40"
"Wilson, Robert Henry","Robert Charles Wilson","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  One night in October when he was ten years old, Tyler Dupree stood in his back yard and watched the stars go out. They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier. He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout. It would shape their lives.     The effect is worldwide. The sun is now a featureless disk--a heat source, rather than an astronomical object. The moon is gone, but tides remain. Not only have the world’s artificial satellites fallen out of orbit, their recovered remains are pitted and aged, as though they’d been in space far longer than their known lifespans. As Tyler, Jason, and Diane grow up, a space probe reveals a bizarre truth: The barrier is artificial, generated by huge alien artifacts. Time is passing faster outside the barrier than inside--more than a hundred million years per year on Earth. At this rate, the death throes of the sun are only about forty years in our future.     Jason, now a promising young scientist, devotes his life to working against this slow-moving apocalypse. Diane throws herself into hedonism, marrying a sinister cult leader who’s forged a new religion out of the fears of the masses.    Earth sends terraforming machines to Mars to let the onrush of time do its work, turning the planet green. Next they send humans…and immediately get back an emissary with thousands of years of stories to tell about the settling of Mars. Then Earth’s probes reveal that an identical barrier has appeared around Mars. Jason, desperate, seeds near space with self-replicating machines that will scatter copies of themselves outward from the sun--and report back on what they find.     Life on Earth is about to get much, much stranger.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Robert Charles Wilson\Spin (1060)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:40:40+02:00","epub","9780765348258","1060","isbn:9780765348258","","Calibre Library","2010-02-20T02:00:00+02:00","Tor Science Fiction","4","Tom Doherty Associates Book","1.0","410612","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Science Fiction And Fantasy","Spin","Spin","b21807ca-d7e7-4f4d-9f44-3a6d9b357796"

"Williamson, Michael","Michael Z. Williamson","SUMMARY: When an exploration ship from Freehold discovered a planet with intelligent lifeforms—the first which humans had ever encountered—it should have been the most important event in history. And it might be—for all the wrong reasons.                  Corporations on Freehold were eager to sell high-tech toys to the Ithkuil, as the inhabitants called themselves, which had the potential to disrupt their society. Then there was the U.N., which controlled the planet Earth. Earth and Freehold were not on good terms, to put it mildly, and the U.N. immediately sent its own ship to make contact with the Ithkuil. If the authoritarians from Earth started throwing their weight around, Freehold would have to push back, causing anything from a diplomatic incident to outright war. And then another ship arrived, full of idealistic do-gooders determined to keep the Ithkuil in their unspoiled state of nature . . .                  The whole thing was turning into a cross between a Marx Brothers farce and a Kafkaesque nightmare, with a potential for Greek tragedy. Contact with a more advance civilization might pose a danger to the Ithkuil, but it definitely was becoming more dangerous to the human factions, and the situation was a powder keg just waiting for a spark to cause a very deadly explosion. . . .","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Michael Z.

"Williams, Walter Jon","Walter Jon Williams","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  It starts with the dogs. They won't stop barking. And then the earth shrugs 8.9 on the Richter scale. It's the world's biggest earthquake since Lisbon in 1755, and it doesn't hit California or Japan or Mexico, but New Madrid, Missouri, a sleepy town on the Mississippi River. Seismologists had predicted the scope of the disaster . . . but no one listened.  For hundreds of miles around, dams burst, engulfing entire counties in tidal waves of mud and debris. Cities collapse into piles of brick and shards of glass. Hospitals and schools crumble. Bridges twist and snap, spilling rush-hour traffic into rivers already swollen with bodies. Within minutes, there is nothing but chaos and ruin from St. Louis to Vicksburg, from Kansas City to Louisville. Every bridge down, every highway torn, every house gone.  America's heartland has fallen into the nightmare known as the Rifta fault line in the earth that wrenchingly exposes the fractures in American society itself. As a strange white mist smelling of sulfur rises from the crevassed ground, the real terror begins for the survivors, who will soon envy the dead, including:    Jason Adams, a teenager separated from his mother;  Nick Ruford, an African-American engineer searching for his estranged daughter;    Noble Frankland, the TV preacher whose visions of hell have become all too real;  Larry Hallock, a technician working frantically to prevent a nuclear meltdown at his power station;  and Omar Paxton, a sheriff and Ku Klux Klansman who seeks racial vengeance in the turmoil of disaster.   Walter J. Williams has created a modern American disaster saga, a story based on terrifying fact, filled with nonstop action, and peopled with characters who are heartbreakingly real. Witnessing authentic heroes surfacing in the unlikeliest places, you will share their horror, feel their despair, and triumph with them in their struggle to survive. One thing you will know for sure: It con happen here. And sooner or later, it will.  A Disaster Waiting to Happen  It was the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who finally made the Swampeast habitable. Just south of Cape Girardeau the levee line began, to Continue 2,200 miles to the Gulf of Mexico. The levees kept the floodwaters Out. During the decades of prosperity, the farmers had forgotten the conditions under which they had prospered were artificial. Southeastern Missouri was as artificial as the Washington Monument, the St. Louis Gateway Arch, or the space shuttle, and like these, existed as a monument to the ingenuity of humankind. The land there had been manufactured.  But that which is artificial occupies a precarious position in the world of nature. Its existence depends upon the maintenance of the conditions under which it was designed. The Mississippi River's levee system was built with the understanding that two things would remain constant: The flood waters would not rise much higher than they had in the past, and the land on which the levees were built would not move of its own accord. The first of these constants was violated regularly. The result was a greater commitment to reinforced levees. The second constant, the requirement that the earth not move, had not been tested.  *Though such a test, as history showed, was inevitable.*","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Walter Jon Williams\The Rift (1069)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:40:42+02:00","epub","9780061052941","1069","isbn:9780061052941","","Calibre Library","1999-06-24T01:00:00+02:00","HarperPrism","4","","1.0","1014515","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Modern fiction, Popular American Fiction, Natural disasters, Rifts (Geology), Earthquakes","The Rift","Rift, The","209c1d6f-cdbe-43c5-9ffa-e4c6a69355e2"

"Williams, David H.","David J. Williams","SUMMARY: In his electrifying debut,The Mirrored Heavens,David J. Williams created a dark futuristic world grounded in the military rivalries, terror tactics, and political wrangling of our own time. Now he takes his masterful blend of military SF, espionage thriller, and dystopian cyberpunk one step further—to the edge of annihilation . . . . Life as U.S. counterintelligence agent Claire Haskell once knew it is in tatters—her mission betrayed, her lover dead, and her memories of the past suspect. Worse, the defeat of the mysterious insurgent group known as Autumn Rain was not as complete as many believed. It is quickly becoming clear that the group’s ultimate goal is not simply to destroy the tenuous global alliances of the 22nd century—but to rule all of humanity. And they’re starting with the violent destruction of the Net and the assassination of the U.S. president. Now it’s up to Claire, with her ability to jack her brain into the systems of the enemy, to win this impossible war. Battling ferociously across the Earth-Moon system, and navigating a complex world filled with both steadfast loyalists and ruthless traitors, Claire must be ready for the Rain’s next move. But the true enemy may already be one step ahead of her. From the Trade Paperback edition.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\David J.

"Williams, David H.","David J. Williams","SUMMARY: In this thrilling debut, David J. Williams delivers a hard-hitting blend of military SF and dystopian cyberpunk, set in a futuristic landscape where hostilities rage from the Eastern and Western hemispheres to the outer ranges of space. In the 22nd century, the first wonder of a brave new world is the Phoenix Space Elevator, designed to give mankind greater access to the frontier beyond Earth. Built by the U.S./Pan-Asian Coalition, the Elevator is also a grand symbol of superpower alliance following a second cold war. And it’s just been destroyed. The South American insurgent group Autumn Rain claims responsibility for the attack, but with suspicions rampant, armies and espionage teams are mobilized across the globe and beyond. Enter Claire Haskell and Jason Marlowe, U.S. counterintelligence agents, and former lovers—though their memories may only be constructs implanted by their spymaster. Forced to set aside the enigma of their past, their agenda is to trust no one. For in a time of shifting loyalties, the enemy could be anyone—from a shadowy assassin working a questionable mission on the dark side of the moon, to a Euro data thief working under deep cover and wooed into a dangerous pact. As the crisis mounts, and the search for Autumn Rain spans both Earth and Moon, the lives of all those involved will converge in one explosive finale—and a startling aftermath that will rewrite everything they’ve ever known—about their mission, their world, and themselves","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\David J.

"Weisskopf, Mark L. Van Name, T. K. F.","Mark L. Van Name, T. K. F. Weisskopf","SUMMARY: The rate of technological development today is exploding. Such diverse technologies as computing, communications, genetics, biology, and nanotechnology are rapidly pushing humanity to a new singularity, a point at which all the rules change and everything we assume about what it means to be human may no longer apply. Leading science fiction writers such as Wil McCarthy, Esther Friesner, James P. Hogan, Hugo-winner David D. Levine, Dave Freer, Wen Spencer, Mark L. Van Name, and others explore this strangest of new frontiers. From a criminal given a last chance at life in a very new kind of existence to a man struggling to claim his own humanity, from battles in the depths of very strange spaces to an amazing new version of keeping up with the Joneses, the stories in Transhuman take you where no human has gone before--but where many of us might one day go.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Mark L.

"Weber, David J.","David Weber","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Rear Admiral Michelle Henke was commanding one of the ships in a force led by Honor Harrington in an all-out space battle. The odds were against the Star Kingdom forces, and they had to run. But Michelle’s ship was crippled, and had to be destroyed to prevent superior Manticoran technology from falling into Havenite hands, and she and her surviving crew were taken prisoner. Much to her surprise, she was repatriated to Manticore, carrying a request for a summit conference between the leaders of the two sides which might end the war. But a condition of her return was that she gave her parole not to fight against the forces of the Republic of Haven until she had been officially exchanged for a Havenite prisoner of war, so she was given a command far away from the war’s battle lines. What she didn’t realize was that she would find herself on a collision course, not with a hostile government, but with the interstellar syndicate of criminals known as Manpower. And Manpower had its own plans for eliminating Manticore as a possible threat to its lucrative slave trade, deadly plans which remain hidden in the shadows.       *Praise for the Prequel, *The Shadow of Saganami:   “These hugely entertaining and clever adventures are the very epitome of space opera. . . .

"Weber, David J.","David Weber","SUMMARY: Controlled by their tireless electronic brains which were programmed to admit no possibility of defeat, the gigantic robot tanks known as Bolos were almost indestructible, and nearly unstoppable. Their artificial intelligences were designed to make them selflessly serve and protect humans throughout the galaxy and made each Bolo the epitome of the knight sans peur et sans reproche, and often far more noble than the humans who gave them their orders. Now, David Weber, New York Times best-selling author of the Honor Harrington series, continues the history of the Bolo, in four short novels, one of them published here for the first time. One Bolo is driven over the edge by the very humans it is pledged to protect. Another Bolo must decide whether or not to disobey when it is given an order that constitutes genocide. A third must hunt one of its own kind whose robot brain is damaged and rescue two children which the deranged Bolo thinks it is protecting from a nonexistent enemy. And more, including as a bonus, David Weber's own authoritative technical history of the Bolo, all in a volume that will be irresistible both for David Weber's huge readership and Bolo fans everywhere.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\David Weber\Bolo!

"Weaver, Umberto Eco; William","Umberto Eco; William Weaver","SUMMARY: Bored with their work, three Milanese editors cook up ""the Plan,"" a hoax that connects the medieval Knights Templar with other occult groups from ancient to modern times. This produces a map indicating the geographical point from which all the powers of the earth can be controlleda point located in Paris, France, at Foucaults Pendulum. But in a fateful turn the joke becomes all too real, and when occult groups, including Satanists, get wind of the Plan, they go so far as to kill one of the editors in their quest to gain control of the earth. Orchestrating these and other diverse characters into his multilayered semiotic adventure, Eco has created a superb cerebral entertainment.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Umberto Eco; William Weaver\Foucault's Pendulum (1132)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:40:54+02:00","epub","9780156032971","1132","isbn:9780156032971","","Calibre Library","2007-02-27T02:00:00+02:00","Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","","","1.0","572083","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Occult, Fiction - General, Occult fiction, Literary, Religion, Psychological, Psychological fiction, Psychology, Body, Eco, Mind & Spirit, Alchemists, Italian Novel And Short Story, Voodooism, Occultism, Foucault's pendulum, Cognitive Psychology, Thought and thinking, Comparative Religion, Religions, Umberto - Prose & Criticism, Idolatry, Occult & Supernatural","Foucault's Pendulum","Foucault's Pendulum","1180ea2a-3cfb-4c5f-8b6e-8265bac07229"

At first, not even the rifters know what they have in themand by the time anyone else finds out, the outcast and the downtrodden have their hands on a kill switch for the whole damn planet.                                                                 ""No one has taken this premise to such pitiless lengthsand depthsas Watts . . . In a claustrophobic setting enlivened by periodic flashes of beauty and terror, the crew of Beebe Station come across as not only believable but likeable as they fight for equilibrium against their own demons, one another, their superiors and their remorselessly hostile surroundings.""***The New York Times***  ""A powerful first novel . . . A savage, bitter, and often blackly comic vision of the near future . . . Watts has rendered a character whose emotional complexity demands our respect. . . . [The ending] is both startling and oddly satisfying in its earned nihilism. A terrific debut from an author we will be seeing again.""***Edmonton Journal***  ""Watts’ true enemy is human stupidity, the sort of thing that turns children into walking disaster zones, treats adults as interchangeable things, insists that unchecked fertility is a Good Thing, and blindly trusts that our artificially intelligent creations must share our priorities. As Watts develops that point, he tells an absorbing tale set in a bizarre world and hinging upon intriguing technology. He's done his homework well, and it shows.""***Analog***  ""Burdened by exploding population, the world turns to geothermal energy from vents thousands of feet under the ocean. The vents are explosive and unpredictable, sending bursts of superheated steam randomly into a nightmare world of transparent fish, 50-foot tube worms, and oddly fragile sea monsters whose teeth shatter when they bite. To survive at such depths, the crews of deep-sea power plants must be modified to withstand the pressure, breathe’ water, and see in a darkness illuminated only by phosphorescent creatures. The necessary mental modification isn't easily done; indeed, only the already emotionally damaged--battered women, paranoid ex-spies, child molesterswon't turn psychotic from it. One crew’s members struggle among themselves at first, but soon discover strange satisfaction in their isolated world and insight into their troubled lives. A subtle paranoia is everywhere, however, from the cramped station quarters to the office of the corporate psychiatrist who selected the crew. The hidden threat behind this unease isn't revealed until nearly the end, but the dark universe of the sea bottom and rich characterization captivate to the last page. Watts makes a brilliant debut with a novel that is part undersea adventure, part psychological thriller, and wholly original.""**Roberta Johnson, *Booklist***  ""Near/medium-future deep-sea endeavor, from a Toronto-resident newcomer. To tap the energy of ocean-floor hydrothermal vents, the powerful Grid Authority sets up a power station in the Juan de Fuca Rift west of Seattle. Humans, physically modified to be able to live and work underwater without the restrictions of diving equipment, will maintain the facility. Of these volunteers (sex criminals, psychopaths, wife-beaters, and child molesters: their alternative is brainwashing), some can't adapt to the crushing, claustrophobic environment. Others brim with suppressed violence. Gerry Fischer takes to eating the local wildlife and never returns to the station. Lenie Clarke suspects that all the members of the group have been deliberately mentally damaged so they won't want to leave. But the Rifters develop a telepathic awareness of each other's thoughts and feelings. On the surface, meanwhile, smart gelsjelly-like intelligent neural networksrun most of the equipment and are slated to replace the Rifters, who refuse to return to the surface. The Grid Authority learns that the Rifters, and all deep-water life-forms, harbor an archaic non-DNA microorganism, ßehemoth, that would destroy all DNA-based life if it reached land. At the same time, Lenie discovers on the ocean floor a nuclear bomb operated by a smart gel; it will trigger a devastating earthquake should ßehemoth escape. Problem is, nobody at the Grid Authority understands how the smart gels evaluate information. What if the gels prefer ßehemoth to orthodox life-forms? . . . Fizzing with ideas, and glued together with dark psychological tensions: an exciting debut.""***Kirkus Reviews***  ""In the near future, energy comes from the geothermal waters of the deep ocean, but the cost of providing power for the surface has a price--the sanity of the physically modified humans (""rifters"") who live in an alien and dangerous environment. Watts's first novel elegantly captures the isolation and claustrophobia of the lightless ocean depths, smoothly blending psychological suspense with high-tech sf adventure. Large libraries should consider adding this to their sf collections.""***Library Journal***  ""Set in the early 21st century, Watts's debut describes a future when the search for energy leads to the tapping of geothermal sources deep in the ocean, as in the Pacific's Juan de Fuca Rift, near Canada's Northwest coast. The maintenance workers of the dangerous underwater power plants are selected for their psychotic tendencies, which enable them to forget their previous lives on dry land, and are then surgically altered to survive the intense pressure of the sea's abyssal depths. These changes, which render the workers amphibious, also leave them less than well equipped to face the threat of powerful, archaic bacterialike creatures that proliferate at the ocean bottom and use human hosts to carry them upward to dry land, where their superior DNA could render our species obsolete. The human resistance to these life forms is described with a great deal of explicit violence and graphic language, as well as well-orchestrated paranoia that recalls the classic SF tale Who Goes There?’ Watts’s characterizations aren't strong but, as in Arthur C. Clarke's *The Deep Range*, the underwater setting and the technology employed there function as characters in their own right, and quite vigorously. The novel's pacing is excellent, making this, overall, a good bet for beach reading.""***Publishers Weekly***  ""There are enough provocative ideas in *Starfish* to suggest that Watts does his homework and thinks things through, and enough skill at scene and dialogue writing to convince us that he's a fine craftsman""**Gary K. Wolfe, *Locus***  ""An interesting, entertaining, and, best of all, promising debut novel.""**Don D’Ammassa, *Science Fiction Chronicle***  ""I read *Starfish* in several large gulps. The story drives like a futuristic locomotive. It's a hypnotic read, somber and compelling. Best thing I've read in a long time. Peter Watts is an author to watch for.""**Robert Sheckley**  ""Peter Watts deliverssolid, inventive hard SF about the deep sea, but as we've never seen before. This moves like the wind.""**Gregory Benford, author of *Cosm***  ""With gritty action and realistic science, Peter Watts brings to life a dark and vivid world.""**David Brin**  ""Peter Watts bathes a gonzo, hopeless pessimism reminiscent of Philip K. Dick or Joanna Russ in the cold, edgy light of hard science fiction á la Benford, Bear, or Tiptree. In Starfish, Watts creates in his protagonist a poetry of dysfunction which is angry and eerily redemptive, and which makes compelling, almost compulsive reading.""**Jane Dorsey**","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Peter Watts\Starfish (1134)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:40:54+02:00","epub","9780765315960","1134","isbn:9780765315960","","Calibre Library","2008-04-29T01:00:00+02:00","Tor Books","4","Rifters Trilogy","1.0","310425","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Space Opera, Adventure, Fantasy, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Marine animals, Underwater exploration, English Canadian Novel And Short Story","Starfish","Starfish","ee22412d-ae78-4cc9-94e3-276b90e8359a"

"Vinge, Vernor","Vernor Vinge","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Four time Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge has taken readers to the depths of space and into the far future in his bestselling novels *A Fire Upon the Deep* and *A Deepness in the Sky*. Now, he has written a science-fiction thriller set in a place and time as exciting and strange as any far-future world: San Diego, California, 2025.     Robert Gu is a recovering Alzheimer's patient. The world that he remembers was much as we know it today. Now, as he regains his faculties through a cure developed during the years of his near-fatal decline, he discovers that the world has changed and so has his place in it. He was a world-renowned poet. Now he is seventy-five years old, though by a medical miracle he looks much younger, and he’s starting over, for the first time unsure of his poetic gifts. Living with his son’s family, he has no choice but to learn how to cope with a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum, layers of reality built on digital views seen by a single person or millions, depending on your choice. But the consensus reality of the digital world is available only if, like his thirteen-year-old granddaughter Miri, you know how to wear your wireless accessthrough nodes designed into *smart* clothesand to see the digital contextthrough *smart* contact lenses.      With knowledge comes risk. When Robert begins to re-train at Fairmont High, learning with other older people what is second nature to Miri and other teens at school, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination.      In a world where every computer chip has Homeland Security built-in, this conspiracy is something that baffles even the most sophisticated security analysts, including Robert’s son and daughter-in law, two top people in the U.S. military. And even Miri, in her attempts to protect her grandfather, may be entangled in the plot.      As Robert becomes more deeply involved in conspiracy, he is shocked to learn of a radical change planned for the UCSD Geisel Library; all the books there, and worldwide, would cease to physically exist. He and his fellow re-trainees feel compelled to join protests against the change. With forces around the world converging on San Diego, both the conspiracy and the protest climax in a spectacular moment as unique and satisfying as it is unexpected. This is science fiction at its very best, by a master storyteller at his peak.                                                        **Vernor Vinge**, author of such acclaimed novels as *True Names*, *The Peace War*, *Marooned in Realtime*, *A Fire Upon the Deep*, and *A Deepness in the Sky*, has won four Hugo Awards. A mathematician and computer scientist, he lives in San Diego, California.                                                            **Winner of the Hugo Award**  Four time Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge has taken readers to the depths of space and into the far future in his bestselling novels *A Fire Upon the Deep* and *A Deepness in the Sky*. Now, he has written a science-fiction thriller set in a place and time as exciting and strange as any far-future world: San Diego, California, 2025.    Robert Gu is a recovering Alzheimer's patient, cured by modern medicine after years of a near-fatal decline. As he struggles to make his was in a much-changed world, where a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum has taken over the world, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination.  With one foot in the present, and the other one sliding into an uncertain future, Vinge offers a story of the potential joys and hazzards that accompany our rapidly changing relationship to technology and the world. This is science fiction at its very best, by a master storyteller at his peak.                                                   ""In the near future, the European Center for Defense against Disease discovers a diabolical pseudomimivirus. Rather than set off a panic, secret agents of the EU, Japan, and India work clandestinely to uncover a conspiracy seemingly based in a San Diego lab. Former poet Robert Gu, a recovering Alzheimer's patient (one of the lucky few who took to all the treatments), returns to school just as agents Braun, Vaz, and Mitsuri put their wheels in motion. Immensely frustrated by simultaneously living with his son's family and completely reeducating himself, Gu becomes a perfect dupe for the hacker hired by the gang of spooks. Under cover of a library protest, Gu and some old friends get into the lab, trailed by one of Gu's adolescent classmates and his granddaughter. The conspiracy runs deep and has some terrifying implications on account of YGBM (you gotta believe me) technology, regardless of the conspirators' intentions. The near future is less alien here than in some of Vinge's other work, but no less fascinating and well constructed.""**Regina Schroeder, *Booklist***  ""Set in San Diego, Calif., this hard SF novel from Hugo-winner Vinge offers dazzling computer technology . . . Circa 2025, people use high-tech contact lenses to interface with computers in their clothes. ""Silent messaging"" is so automatic that it feels like telepathy. Robert Gu, a talented Chinese-American poet, has missed much of this revolution due to Alzheimer's, but now the wonders of modern medicine have rehabilitated his mind. Installed in remedial classes at the local high school, he tries to adjust to this brave new world, but soon finds himself enmeshed in a somewhat quixotic plot by elderly former University of California-San Diego faculty members to protest the destruction of the university library, now rendered superfluous by the ubiquitous online databanks. Unbeknownst to Robert, he's also a pawn in a dark international conspiracy to perfect a deadly biological weapon.""***Publishers Weekly***","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Vernor Vinge\Rainbows End (1140)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:40:56+02:00","epub","9780812536362","1140","isbn:9780812536362","","Calibre Library","2010-06-13T01:00:00+02:00","Tor Science Fiction","3","","1.0","422575","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Science Fiction And Fantasy, 20th century, Patients, Poets; American, Alzheimer's disease","Rainbows End","Rainbows End","376e35f3-3901-468e-a0af-221e63fb1c1c"
"Vinge, Vernor","Vernor Vinge","SUMMARY: Multiple Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge takes readers on a fifty-million-year trip to a future where humanity's fate will be decided in a dangerous game of high-tech survival. In this taut thriller, a Hugo finalist for Best Novel, nobody knows why there are only three hundred humans left alive on the Earth fifty million years from now. Opinion is fiercely divided on whether to settle in and plant the seed of mankind anew, or to continue using high-energy stasis fields, or ""bobbles,"" in venturing into the future. When somebody is murdered, it's obvious someone has a secret he or she is willing to kill to preserve.The murder intensifies the rift between the two factions, threatening the survival of the human race. It's up to 21st century detective Wil Brierson, the only cop left in the world, to find the culprit, a diabolical fiend whose lust for power could cause the utter extinction of man. Filled with excitement and adventure, Vinge's tense SF puzzler will satisfy readers with its sense of wonder and engaging characters, one of whom is a murderer with a unique modus operandi.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Vernor Vinge\Marooned in Realtime (1141)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:40:56+02:00","epub","9780765308849","1141","isbn:9780765308849","","Calibre Library","2004-09-14T01:00:00+02:00","Tor Books","4","","1.0","299329","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Space Opera, Adventure, Fantasy, Life on other planets, Thrillers, Time travel, Murder","Marooned in Realtime","Marooned in Realtime","8b312fed-0384-4429-97fd-60d5f2b7a5e3"

The Peace Authority conquered the world with a weapon that never should have been a weapon--the ""bobble,"" a spherical force-field impenetrable by any force known to mankind. Encasing governmental installations and military bases in bobbles, the Authority becomes virtually omnipotent. But they've never caught Paul Hoehler, the maverick who invented the technology, and who has been working quietly for decades to develop a way to defeat the Authority. With the help of an underground network of determined, independent scientists and a teenager who may be the apprentice genius he's needed for so long, he will shake the world, in the fast-paced hard-science thriller that garnered Vinge the first of his four Hugo nominations for best novel.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Vernor Vinge\The Peace War (1143)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:40:56+02:00","epub","9780765308832","1143","isbn:9780765308832","","Calibre Library","2003-11-18T02:00:00+02:00","Tor Books","4","","1.0","280048","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Technology, Political, Political fiction, Technology - Political aspects, Inventors, Political aspects, Power (Social sciences)","The Peace War","Peace War, The","7286b06f-778c-4783-9c19-b084e8bd620e"

"Turtledove, Harry","Harry Turtledove","SUMMARY: Harry Turtledove’s remarkable alternative history novels brilliantly remind us of how fragile the thread of time can be, and offer us a world of “what if.” Drawing on a magnificent cast of characters that includes soldiers, generals, lovers, spies, and demagogues, Turtledove returns to an epic tale that only he could tell–the story of a North American continent, separated into two bitterly opposed nations, that stands on the verge of exploding once again.In 1914 they called it The Great War, and few could imagine anything worse. For nearly three decades a peace forged in blood and fatigue has held sway in North America. Now, Japan dominates the Pacific, the Russian Tsar rules Alaska, and England, under Winston Churchill, chafes for a return to its former glory. But behind the façade of world order, America is a bomb waiting to go off. Jake Featherston, the megalomaniacal leader of the Confederate States of America, is just the man to light the fuse. In the White House in Philadelphia, Socialist President Al Smith is a living symbol of hope for a nation that has been through the fires of war and the flood tides of depression. In the South, Featherston and his ruling Freedom Party have put down a Negro rebellion with a bloody fist and have interned them in concentration camps. Now they are determined to crush their Northern neighbor at any cost. Featherston’s planes attack Philadelphia without warning. The U.S.A. lashes back blindly at Charleston. And a terrible second coming is at hand. When the CSA blitzkrieg is launched, the U.S.A. is caught flat-footed. Before long, the gray Army reaches Lake Erie. But in its wake the war machine is spinning a vortex of destruction, betrayal, and fury that no one, not even Jake Featherston himself, can control. Now, President Smith faces a Herculean task, while an obscure assistant secretary of war named Roosevelt rises in his ranks. For the U.S.A., the darkest days still lay ahead. Across the globe, a new era of war has just begun. And in the hands of the incomparable Harry Turtledove, readers are treated to a masterful vision of what might have been. An enduring portrait of history, nations, and human nature in its many manifestations, Return Engagement is a monumental journey into the second half of the twentieth century.From the Hardcover edition.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Harry Turtledove\Settling Accounts Return Engagement (1180)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:41:07+02:00","epub","9780345464057","1180","isbn:9780345464057","","Calibre Library","2005-06-28T01:00:00+02:00","Del Rey","3","","1.0","583457","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Adventure, Fantasy, Alternative histories (Fiction), World War; 1939-1945, Alternative History, War & Military, History, War stories, Political, World War II, Alternate histories (Fiction), Alternative histories (Fiction); American, North America, Military","Settling Accounts Return Engagement (Settling Accounts Trilogy)","Settling Accounts Return Engagement (Settling Accounts Trilogy)","657fbf1d-95d1-461d-b6b2-146796000ee3"

"Turtledove, Harry","Harry Turtledove","SUMMARY: From Harry Turtledove, the master of alternate history, comes After the Downfall, a novel of magic, epic warfare, and desperate choices. 1945: Russian troops have entered Berlin, and are engaged in a violent orgy of robbery, rape, and revenge. Wehrmacht officer Hasso Pemsel, a career soldier on the losing end of the greatest war in history, flees from a sniper's bullet, finding himself hurled into a mysterious, fantastic world of wizards, dragons, and unicorns. There he allies himself with the blond-haired, blue-eyed Lenelli, and Velona, their goddess in human form, offering them his knowledge of warfare and weaponry in their genocidal struggle against a race of diminutive, swarthy barbarians known as Grenye. But soon, the savagery of the Lenelli begins to eat at Hasso Pemsel's soul, causing him to question everything he has long believed about race and Reich, right and wrong, Ubermenschen and Untermenschen. Hasso Pemsel will learn the difference between following orders... and following his conscience.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Harry Turtledove\After the Downfall (1185)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:41:08+02:00","epub","9781597801317","1185","isbn:9781597801317","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","Night Shade Books","3","","1.0","392332","Science fiction, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fantasy, Short Stories, Fantasy - General, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Fantasy fiction, Fiction - Fantasy, Fantasy - Short Stories, Graphic Novels: General, Graphic novels, History, 1918-1945, Berlin (Germany), Alternative histories","After the Downfall","After the Downfall","3ec46e78-6024-4ba8-b255-1a007a67995b"

"Tigerman, Gary","Gary Tigerman","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Project Orion. It's a revolutionary space-based defense shield, only weeks away from deployment. Promising global protection from missile attack by rogue nations, Orion offers an ""umbrella"" of security to a terror-stricken world. But even the loftiest aims often conceal darker intentions. Behind closed doors, insiders maneuver to control the new superweapon with an agenda that places all mankind at risk.  When Angela Browning, an ambitious journalist, receives a mysterious computer disk from an anonymous source, she can't believe the information it contains: photos of ancient structures on the planet Mars. But after diligent research, Angela discovers that the images originated from the Mars Observer probe, a satellite declared ""lost"" over a decade before. Perhaps even more troubling than the artifacts themselves is the implication that somehow, somewhere in the corridors of power, it's been decided that the discovery of intelligent life on Mars must be suppressed.  Angela's quest for the truth eventually leads her to Jake Deaver, the commander of the last Apollo mission to the moon. Deaver, a maverick his whole career, may be the only one who can help her shed light on a conspiracy that reaches into the darkest corners of Washington politics. But the pair's investigation takes them dangerously close to Project Orion, and a powerful cabal determined to prevent anyone from jeopardizing their plans. Now Jake and Angela must face the stark reality that pursuing the truth may put both their lives at risk. And the choice they make will change the world forever.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Gary Tigerman\The Orion Protocol (1199)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:41:13+02:00","epub","9780380799206","1199","isbn:9780380799206","","Calibre Library","2004-11-11T02:00:00+02:00","New York : Morrow, c2003.","4","","1.0","263334","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Space Opera, Adventure, Life on other planets, Suspense, Thrillers, Mystery & Detective, American Mystery & Suspense Fiction, Mystery, Biography & Autobiography, Mars (Planet), Journalists, Official secrets, Editors; Journalists; Publishers","The Orion Protocol","Orion Protocol, The","8a585d64-935e-4eec-890c-3dcf26ffbe2a"

"Thor, Brad","Brad Thor","SUMMARY: A weapon designed to decimate the Roman Empire has just become the number one threat to the United States.From the national bestselling author of The Lions of Lucerne, Path of the Assassin, and State of the Union comes the most gripping international thriller yet featuring Navy SEAL turned covert counterterrorism agent Scot Harvath.""Scot Harvath is the perfect all-American hero for the post-September 11th world.""-- Nelson DeMilleWhen a mystery thousands of years in the making threatens to catapult the enemies of America to a sure and decisive victory, the only person the president can call for help is the man the administration has just fired.Caught live on Al Jazeera in an off-the-books operation, Scot Harvath's career has been terminated and he is forced to go to ground as the president bows to pressure from a ruthless senator with her sights set on the White House. But when the tide in the war on terror suddenly turns against the U.S., the president has no choice but to secretly bring Harvath back inside. Ducking a congressional subpoena, Harvath travels to the Mediterranean, where he learns of a shadowy organization that has been combing the earth for decades in search of the ultimate weapon to use against the United States and her allies. Now, after three summers of record-setting heat across present-day Europe, one steadily melting Alpine glacier has given up an ancient secret--one with the potential to thrust civilization back into the Dark Ages.From Cyprus, London, and Paris, to Italy, Switzerland, and Saudi Arabia, Harvath must race against the clock to stop one of the greatest evils ever to face the United States. With his characteristic high-voltage action, sweeping international locales, and meticulous research, Brad Thor has created another supercharged novel that is sure to thrill.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Brad Thor\Blowback_ A Thriller (1211)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:41:16+02:00","epub","9781416553472","1211","isbn:9781416553472","","Calibre Library","2008-06-17T01:00:00+02:00","Simon & Schuster","4","","1.0","355639","General, Fiction, Suspense, Thrillers, Americans, Political, Terrorism, Middle East, Adult Assortments Not to Be Sold Separately","Blowback: A Thriller","Blowback: A Thriller","e4aec492-c96f-459a-ac0a-77b2fc6d0e1f"
"Thor, Brad","Brad Thor","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  **A master assassin. A vendetta years in the making. And a counterterrorism operative who will risk everything -- even treason -- to keep the people he loves alive.**  Brad Thor, the *New York Times* bestselling author of *Takedown,* delivers an explosive international thriller featuring Navy SEAL turned Homeland Security operative Scot Harvath, who somewhere, somehow, has left the wrong person alive.  ""Thou shalt not negotiate with terrorists...""  **Six months ago:** In the dead of the night, five of the most dangerous detainees in the war on terror are pulled from their isolation cells in Guantanamo Bay, held at gunpoint, and told to strip off their orange jumpsuits. Issued civilian clothes and driven to the base airfield, they are loaded aboard a Boeing 727 and set free.  **Present day:** Covert counterterrorism agent Scot Harvath awakens to discover that his world has changed violently -- and forever. A sadistic assassin with a personal vendetta is wreaking havoc of biblical proportions. Unleashing nightmarish horrors on those closest to Harvath, the attacker thrusts everything Harvath holds dear -- including his life -- into absolute peril.  Ordered by the president to stay out of the investigation, Harvath is forced to mount his own operation to uncover the conspiracy and to exact revenge. When he discovers a connection between the attacks and a group of prisoners secretly released from Guantanamo, Harvath must ask himself previously unthinkable questions about the organizations and the nation he has spent his life serving.  A renegade from his own government, Harvath will place his life on the line as his search for the truth draws him into a showdown with one of the most dangerous men on the face of the earth.  Brad Thor roars through this nonstop adventure full of international intrigue, twisted betrayals, and ultimate revenge.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Brad Thor\The First Commandment_ A Thriller (1212)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:41:16+02:00","epub","9781416543800","1212","isbn:9781416543800","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","Pocket","4","","1.0","260511","General, Fiction, Adventure, Thrillers, Modern fiction, American Mystery & Suspense Fiction, Fiction - Espionage, thriller, Political","The First Commandment: A Thriller","First Commandment: A Thriller, The","6732bdbc-06c2-449a-97de-3da73bf4ffcd"

"Taleb, Nassim Nicholas","Nassim Nicholas Taleb","Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the bestselling author of *The Black Swan* and one of the foremost thinkers of our time, reveals how to thrive in an uncertain world.  
  
Just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension, and rumors or riots intensify when someone tries to repress them, many things in life benefit from stress, disorder, volatility, and turmoil. What Taleb has identified and calls “antifragile” is that category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish.   
  
In *The Black Swan,* Taleb showed us that highly improbable and unpredictable events underlie almost everything about our world. In *Antifragile,* Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, even necessary, and proposes that things be built in an antifragile manner. The antifragile is beyond the resilient or robust. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better.   
  
Furthermore, the antifragile is immune to prediction errors and protected from adverse events. Why is the city-state better than the nation-state, why is debt bad for you, and why is what we call “efficient” not efficient at all? Why do government responses and social policies protect the strong and hurt the weak? Why should you write your resignation letter before even starting on the job? How did the sinking of the *Titanic* save lives? The book spans innovation by trial and error, life decisions, politics, urban planning, war, personal finance, economic systems, and medicine. And throughout, in addition to the street wisdom of Fat Tony of Brooklyn, the voices and recipes of ancient wisdom, from Roman, Greek, Semitic, and medieval sources, are loud and clear.  
  
 *Antifragile* is a blueprint for living in a Black Swan world.  
  
Erudite, witty, and iconoclastic, Taleb’s message is revolutionary: The antifragile, and only the antifragile, will make it.  

 **Praise for *Antifragile** *  
  
“Taleb takes on everything from the mistakes of modern architecture to the dangers of meddlesome doctors and how overrated formal education is. . . . An ambitious and thought-provoking read . . . highly entertaining.”—* The Economist*  

 *From the Hardcover edition.*

### About the Author
 **Nassim Nicholas Taleb** has devoted his life to problems of uncertainty, probability, and knowledge. He spent nearly two decades as a businessman and quantitative trader before becoming a full-time philosophical essayist and academic researcher in 2006. Although he spends most of his time in the intense seclusion of his study, or as a flâneur meditating in cafés, he is currently Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering at New York University’s Polytechnic Institute. His main subject matter is “decision making under opacity”—that is, a map and a protocol on how we should live in a world we don’t understand.  
  
Taleb’s books have been published in thirty-three languages.

"Taleb, Nassim","Nassim Nicholas Taleb","A BLACK SWAN is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.  Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”  For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now, in this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don’t know. He offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.  Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications, The Black Swan will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. The Black Swan is a landmark book—itself a black swan.  Nassim Nicholas Taleb has devoted his life to immersing himself in problems of luck, uncertainty, probability, and knowledge. Part literary essayist, part empiricist, part no-nonsense mathematical trader, he is currently taking a break by serving as the Dean’s Professor in the Sciences of Uncertainty at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. His last book, the bestseller Fooled by Randomness, has been published in twenty languages, Taleb lives mostly in New York.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Nassim Nicholas Taleb\The Black Swan_ The Impact of the H (1260)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:41:27+02:00","epub","","1260","uri:urn:uuid:094f97ca-a615-4f83-a02c-46470aa909a8","eng","Calibre Library","2007-06-15T00:00:00+02:00","Random House","","","1.0","1425750","sci_history, sci_culture, Nonfiction","The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable -0","Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable -0, The","05f680cd-6149-4337-a2c7-a3136f7ab88a"

"Unknown","Matthew Syed","<b>Nobody wants to fail. But in highly complex organizations, success can happen only when we confront our mistakes, learn from our own version of a black box, and create a climate where it's safe to fail. <br>&#12288;<br></b>We all have to endure failure from time to time, whether it's underperforming at a job interview, flunking an exam, or losing a pickup basketball game. But for people working in safety-critical industries, getting it wrong can have deadly consequences. Consider the shocking fact that preventable medical error is the third-biggest killer in the United States, causing more than 400,000 deaths every year. More people die from mistakes made by doctors and hospitals than from traffic accidents.

"Suarez, Daniel","Daniel Suarez","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  **The propulsive, shockingly plausible sequel to *New York Times* bestseller *Daemon*, the ""Greatest. Techno-thriller. Period.""*    *William O'Brien, former director of cybersecurity and communications systems policy at the White House **     2009 saw one of the most inventive techno-thriller debuts in decades as Daniel Suarez introduced his terrifying and tantalizing vision of a new world order. *Daemon* captured the attention of the tech community, became a national bestseller, garnered attention from futurists, literary critics, and the halls of government-leaving readers clamoring for the conclusion to Suarez's epic story.      In the opening chapters of *Freedom(tm)*, the Daemon is well on its way toward firm control of the modern world, using an expanded network of real-world, dispossessed darknet operatives to tear apart civilization and rebuild it anew. Civil war breaks out in the American Midwest, with the mainstream media stoking public fear in the face of this 'Corn Rebellion'. Former detective Pete Sebeck, now the Daemon's most famous and most reluctant operative, must lead a small band of enlightened humans in a populist movement designed to protect the new world order.      But the private armies of global business are preparing to crush the Daemon once and for all. In a world of conflicted loyalties, rapidly diminishing government control, and a new choice between free will and the continuing comforts of ignorance, the stakes could not be higher: hanging in the balance is nothing less than democracy's last hope to survive the technology revolution.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Daniel Suarez\Freedom (TM) (1357)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:41:43+02:00","epub","9780525951575","1357","isbn:9780525951575","","Calibre Library","2010-02-28T02:00:00+02:00","Dutton Adult","4","","1.0","404620","Fiction, Thrillers, Mystery And Suspense Fiction, Fiction - Espionage, thriller, Technological, Human-computer interaction, International economic integration, Stockbrokers","Freedom (TM)","Freedom (TM)","9433d656-8229-4c88-945b-f5f8cd0620d2"

"Stirling, S. M.","S. M. Stirling","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  In the parallel world first introduced in S. M. Stirling’s *The Sky People*, aliens terraformed Mars (and Venus) two hundred million years ago, seeding them with life-forms from Earth. Humans didn’t suspect this until the twentieth century, but when the first probes landed on our sister worlds, and found life—intelligent life, at that—things changed with a vengeance. By the year 2000, America, Russia, and the other great powers of Earth are all contending for influence and power amid the newly-discovered inhabitants of our sister planets.      Venus is a primitive world. But on Mars, early hominids evolved civilization earlier than their earthly cousins, driven by the needs of a harsh world growing still harsher as the initial terraforming runs down. Without coal, oil, or uranium, their technology was forced into different paths, and the genetic wizardry of the Crimson Dynasty united a world for more than twenty thousand years.      Now, in a new stand-alone adventure set in this world’s 2000 AD, Jeremy Wainman is an archaeologist who has achieved a lifelong dream; to travel to Mars and explore the dead cities of the Deep Beyond, searching for the secrets of the Kings Beneath the Mountain and the fallen empire they ruled.      Teyud Zha-Zhalt is the Martian mercenary the Terrans hire as guide and captain of the landship Intrepid Traveller. A secret links her to the deadly intrigues of Dvor il-Adazar, the City That Is A Mountain, where the last aging descendant of the Tollamune Emperors clings to the remnants of his power…and secrets that may trace their origin to the enigmatic Ancients, the Lords of Creation who reshaped the Solar System in the time of the dinosaurs.      When these three meet, the foundations of reality will be shaken—from the lost city of Rema-Dza to the courts of the Crimson Kings.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\S. M.

As she savored the ordered, spare beauty of England’s northern fells, the silence was shattered by the shout of a single name: “Annabel!” And there stood one of the angriest, most threatening young men Mary had ever seen. His name was Connor Winslow, and Mary quickly discovered that he thought she was his cousin—a girl supposedly dead these past eight years. Alive, she would be heiress to an inheritance Connor was determined to have for himself.

"Sterling, Bruce","Bruce Sterling","SUMMARY: It's the year 2044, and America has gone to hell. A disenfranchised U.S. Air Force base has turned to highway robbery in order to pay the bills. Vast chunks of the population live nomadic lives fueled by cheap transportation and even cheaper computer power. Warfare has shifted from the battlefield to the global networks, and China holds the information edge over all comers. Global warming is raising sea level, which in turn is drowning coastal cities. And the U.S. government has become nearly meaningless. This is the world that Oscar Valparaiso would have been born into, if he'd actually been born instead of being grown in vitro by black market baby dealers. Oscar's bizarre genetic history (even he's not sure how much of him is actually human) hasn't prevented him from running one of the most successful senatorial races in history, getting his man elected by a whopping majority. But Oscar has put himself out of a job, since he'd only be a liability to his boss in Washington due to his problematic background. Instead, Oscar finds himself shuffled off to the Collaboratory, a Big Science pork barrel project that's run half by corruption and half by scientific breakthroughs. At first it seems to be a lose-lose proposition for Oscar, but soon he has his ""krewe"" whipped into shape and ready to take control of events. Now if only he can straighten out his love life and solve a worldwide crisis that no one else knows exists. --Craig E.

"Sterling, Bruce","Bruce Sterling","SUMMARY: Alongside William Gibson and Neal Stephenson, Bruce Sterling stands at the forefront of a select group of writers whose pitch-perfect grasp of the cultural and scientific zeitgeist endows their works of speculative near-future fiction with uncanny verisimilitude. To read a novel by Sterling is to receive a dispatch from a time traveler. Now, with The Caryatids, Sterling has written a stunning testament of faith in the power of human intellect, creativity, and spirit to overcome any obstacle–even the obstacles we carry inside ourselves. The world of 2060 is divided into three spheres of influence, each fighting with the others over the resources of fallen nations and an environment degraded almost to the point of no return. There is the Dispensation, centered in Los Angeles, where entertainment and capitalism have fused with the highest of high-tech. There is the Acquis, a Green-centered collective that uses invasive neurological technology to create a networked utopia. And there is China, the sole surviving nation-state, a dinosaur that has prospered only by pitilessly pruning its own population. Products of this monstrous world, the daughters of a monstrous mother, and–according to some–monsters themselves, are the Caryatids: the four surviving female clones of a mad Balkan genius and wanted war criminal now ensconced, safely beyond extradition, on an orbiting space station. Radmila is a Dispensation star determined to forget her past by building a glittering, impregnable future. Vera is an Acquis functionary dedicated to reclaiming their home, the Croatian island of Mljet, from catastrophic pollution. Sonja is a medical specialist in China renowned for selflessly risking herself to help others. And Biserka is a one-woman terrorist network. The four “sisters” are united only by their hatred for their “mother”–and for one another. When evidence surfaces of a coming environmental cataclysm, the Dispensation sends its greatest statesman–or salesman–John Montgomery Montalban, husband of Radmila, and lover of Vera and Sonja, to gather the Caryatids together in an audacious plan to save the world.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Bruce Sterling\The Caryatids (1392)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:41:51+02:00","epub","9780345460622","1392","isbn:9780345460622","","Calibre Library","2009-02-24T02:00:00+02:00","Del Rey","2","","1.0","367569","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Adventure, Suspense, Fiction - General, Thrillers, Mystery And Suspense Fiction, Mystery, Human cloning","The Caryatids","Caryatids, The","3c1b1796-f2b2-4403-9ef0-b58bf6d0c51d"

"Sterling, Bruce","Bruce Sterling","SUMMARY: Like his peers William Gibson and Neal Stephenson, bestselling author Bruce Sterling writes cutting-edge speculative fiction firmly rooted in today’s reality. Now inThe Zenith Angle, he has created a timely thriller about an information-age security expert caught up in America’s escalating war on terror. Infowar. Cybercombat. Digital security and techno-terror. It’s how nations and networks secretly battle, now and into the future. And for Derek “Van” Vandeveer, pioneering computer wizard, a new cyberwarrior career begins on the fateful date of September 11, 2001. Happily married with a new baby, pulling down mind-blowing money as a VP of research and development for a booming Internet company, Van has been living extralarge. Then the devastating attacks on America change everything. And Van must decide if he’s willing to use the talents that built his perfect world in order to defend it. “It’s our networks versus their death cult,” says the government operative who recruits Van as the key member of an ultraelite federal computer-security team. In a matter of days, Van has traded his cushy life inside the dot-com bubble for the labyrinthine trenches of the Washington intelligence community—where rival agencies must grudgingly abandon decades of distrust and infighting to join forces against chilling new threats. Van’s special genius is needed to make the country’s defense systems hacker-proof. And if he makes headway there, he’ll find himself troubleshooting ultrasecret spy satellites. America’s most powerful and crucial “eye in the sky,” the KH-13 satellite—capable of detecting terrorist hotbeds worldwide with pinpoint accuracy—is perilously close to becoming an orbiting billion-dollar boondoggle, unless Van can debug the glitch that’s knocked it out of commission. Little does he suspect that the problem has nothing at all to do with software . . . and that what’s really wrong with the KH-13 will force Van to make the unlikely leap from scientist to spy, team up with a ruthlessly resourceful ex–Special Forces commando, and root out an unknown enemy . . . one with access to an undreamed of weapon of untold destructive power.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Bruce Sterling\The zenith angle (1398)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:41:52+02:00","epub","9780345460615","1398","isbn:9780345460615","","Calibre Library","2004-04-27T01:00:00+02:00","New York : Del Rey/Ballantine Books, 2004.","3","","1.0","291041","Science fiction, General, Fiction, High Tech, Computers, Suspense, Thrillers, Mystery & Detective, Science Fiction - High Tech, Fiction - Espionage, thriller, Government investigators, Married people, Espionage, Popular American Fiction, Technological, Intrigue, Political, Political fiction, Computer security, Space surveillance, Security, Colorado, Washington (D.C.), Women astronomers","The zenith angle","zenith angle, The","b8c44f65-0e99-4000-aeae-b6c5c229b4e9"

"Stephenson, Neal","Neal Stephenson","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Decades into our future, a stone's throw from the ancient city of Shanghai, a brilliant nanotechnologist named John Percival Hackworth has just broken therigorous moral code of his tribe, the powerful neoVictorians.  He's made an illicit copy of a state-of-the-art interactive device called *A Young Ladys Illustrated Primer  *Commissioned by an eccentric duke for his grandchild, stolen for Hackworth's own daughter, the *Primer's *purpose is to educate and raise a girl capable of thinking for herself.  It performs its function superbly.  Unfortunately for Hackworth, his smuggled copy has fallen into the wrong hands.  Young Nell and her brother Harv are thetes--members of the poor, tribeless class.  Neglected by their mother, Harv looks after Nell.  When he and his gang waylay a certain neo-Victorian--John Percival Hackworth--  in the seamy streets of their neighborhood, Harv brings Nell something special: the Primer.  Following the discovery of his crime, Hackworth begins an odyssey of his own.  Expelled from the neo-Victorian paradise, squeezed by agents of ProtocolEnforcement on one side and a Mandarin underworld crime lord on the other, he searches for an elusive figure known as the Alchemist.  His quest and Nell'swill ultimately lead them to another seeker whose fate is bound up with the *Primer-- *a woman who holds the key to a vast, subversive informationnetwork that is destined to decode and reprogram the future of humanity.

"Smith, Michael W.","Michael Marshall Smith","SUMMARY: For young Mark, the world has turned as bleak and gray as the Brighton winter. Separated from his real father and home in London, he's come to live with his mother and her new husband in an old house near the sea. He spends his days alone, trying to master the skateboard, while other boys his age are in school. He hates the unwanted stepfather who barged into Mark's life to rob him of joy. Worst of all, his once-vibrant mother has grown listless and weary, no longer interested in anything beyond her sitting room.   But on a damp and chilly evening, an accident carries Mark into the basement flat of the old woman who lives at the bottom of his stepfather's house. She offers tea, cakes, and sympathy . . . and the key to a secret, bygone world. Mark becomes caught up in the frenetic bustle of the human machinery that once ran a home, and drawn ever deeper into a lost realm of spirits and memory. Here below the suffocating truths, beneath the pain and unhappiness, he finds an escape, and quite possibly a way to change everything.   A richly evocative, poignantly beautiful modern-day ghost story, The Servants marks the triumphant return of Michael Marshall Smith—the first novel in a decade from the multiple award-winning author of Spares.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Michael Marshall Smith\The Servants (1451)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:42:01+02:00","epub","9780061494161","1451","isbn:9780061494161","","Calibre Library","2008-08-28T01:00:00+02:00","Eos","5","","1.0","190563","General, Fiction, Fantasy, Fantasy fiction, Fiction - General, Haunted houses, Ghost, Psychological, Psychological fiction, Brighton (England), Boys, English Horror Fiction","The Servants","Servants, The","13def756-63b3-4209-ac0b-17d954d922cf"

On the outbound journey, automatic sensors drop their ship -- the Perseus -- into normal space for an encounter with a mysterious skeletal object. The encounter leaves them baffled, and leads them to a view an epic space battle. But strange as that is, it's nowhere near as mysterious as finding a planet covered in radioactive fuel ore -- and populated with humanoid robots who have been expecting their arrival and greet them as returning masters. . . !","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\E.E.

"Smith, E.E. 'Doc'","E.E. 'Doc' Smith","SUMMARY: One of the most fascinating mysteries of the heavens is the comet. It goes through space, gets near enough to the earth to be seen, and then goes off and disappears in celestial distance. Often it has a hyperbolic orbit, which would make it impossible to come back. Yet it may return -- apparently contradicting the geometry of conic sections. This only goes to prove once more that it is risky to say anything is impossible. . . . A good many of us who are now certain beyond a doubt that space travel will forever remain in the realm of the impossible, probably would, if a rocket that were shot to the moon, for instance, did arrive, and perhaps return to give proof of its safe arrival on our satellite, accept the phenomenon in a perfectly blas, twentieth century manner. Dr. Smith, that phenomenal writer of classic scientific fiction, seems to have become so thoroughly convinced of the advent of interplanetary travel that it is difficult for the reader to feel, after finishing ""Spacehounds of IPC,"" that travel in the great spaces is not already an established fact. Dr. Smith, as a professional chemist, is kept fairly busy. As a writer, he is satisfied with nothing less than perfection.

Wells, possibly those of Jules Verne -- and almost no other writer -- it has inspired more imitators and done more to change the nature of all the science fiction written after it than almost any other single work."" -- Frederik Pohl Finding that his government laboratory coworkers do not believe his discovery of a revolutionary power source that will enable interstellar flight, Dr. Richard Seaton acquires rights to his discovery from the government and commercializes it with the aid of his friend, millionaire inventor Martin Crane. When a former colleague tries to steal the invention, not only the future of Dr. Seaton and his allies, but ultimately the entire world hangs in the balance! The first of the great ""space opera"" science fiction novels, The Skylark of Space remains a thrilling tale more than 80 years after its creation.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\E.E.

"Smith, Cordwainer","Cordwainer Smith","SUMMARY: In a far-flung future, planoforming ships knit together a galaxy ruled from Earth by the ruthless benevolence of the mysterious Lords of the Instrumentality, who presided over a utopia without death, danger¿or freedom. The Underpeople, humanlike beings created from animals to do the work of utopia, had no rights, and could be disposed of at the whim of a human. But they had become more humanlike than their creators, and their leader, the cat woman C¿Mell, had a plan for gaining their freedom¿which made her much too dangerous a person to be permitted to live. Elsewhere in the galaxy, the planet Norstrilia had power of its own, for it was the only source of stroon, the drug which arrested aging and made humans immortal. Its inhabitants were wealthy beyond comprehension, and one of them, a boy named Rod McBan, with the help of his computer, had manipulated the galactic economy until he completely owned the planet Earth¿which made him much too dangerous a person to be permitted to live. But when Rod came to Earth and joined forces with C¿Mell and the Underpeople, the petrified utopia of the Instrumentality began to crack and fall apart as freedom was reborn in the galaxy. . . .","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Cordwainer Smith\We the Underpeople (1481)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:42:06+02:00","epub","9781416520955","1481","isbn:9781416520955","","Calibre Library","2006-11-27T21:30:00+02:00","Baen","","Rod McBan","2.0","138234","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Space Opera, Adventure, Science fiction; American, Short Stories, Science Fiction - Adventure, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Science Fiction - Space Opera, 20th Century American Novel And Short Story, Science Fiction - Short Stories","We the Underpeople","We the Underpeople","3195c6e1-13a4-4587-acfb-a9bb35b98da8"

"Slonczewski, Joan","Joan Slonczewski","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Brain Plague is the new hard SF novel by Joan Slonczewski, set in the same future universe as her award-winning A Door into Ocean and The Children Star (a New York Times Notable Book). An intelligent microbe race that can live symbiotically in other intelligent beings is colonizing the human race throughout the civilized universe.  And each colony of microbes has its own personality, good or bad. In some people, carriers, they are brain enhancers, and in others a fatal brain plague, a living addiction. This is the story of one woman's psychological and moral struggle to adjust to having an ambitious colony of microbes living permanently in her own head. This novel is one of the most powerful and involving SF novels of the year.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Joan Slonczewski\Brain plague (1499)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:42:09+02:00","epub","9780312867188","1499","isbn:9780312867188","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","New York : TOR, 2000.","4","","1.0","311524","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Psychological fiction, Women, Microorganisms, Brain","Brain plague","Brain plague","9f0b29cb-4a91-40ec-8a96-dcd7d138085a"

A ground-breaking work both of feminist SF and of world-building hard SF, it concerns the Sharers of Shora, a nation of women on a distant moon in the far future who are pacifists, highly advanced in biological sciences, and who reproduce by parthenogenesis--there are no males--and tells of the conflicts that erupt when a neighboring civilization decides to develop their ocean world, and send in an army.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Joan Slonczewski\A door into ocean (1500)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:42:09+02:00","epub","9780380701506","1500","isbn:9780380701506","","Calibre Library","1987-02-01T02:00:00+02:00","New York : Avon Books, 1987, c1986.","4","","1.0","375920","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Science fiction; American","A door into ocean","door into ocean, A","493f3930-c847-4ea2-b16d-97f2f34f2cae"

A colony of orphans struggle to survive, and find the planet hides strange secrets. ***** The Prokaryan landscape is ordered, as if by unseen gardeners, ""hidden masters"" no human has ever found. The weather behaves as though designed to meet the planet's needs.

"Simmons, Dan","Dan Simmons","SUMMARY: On June 9, 1865, while traveling by train to London with his secret mistress, 53-year-old Charles Dickens--at the height of his powers and popularity, the most famous and successful novelist in the world and perhaps in the history of the world--hurtled into a disaster that changed his life forever. Did Dickens begin living a dark double life after the accident? Were his nightly forays into the worst slums of London and his deepening obsession with corpses, crypts, murder, opium dens, the use of lime pits to dissolve bodies, and a hidden subterranean London mere research . . . or something more terrifying? Just as he did in The Terror, Dan Simmons draws impeccably from history to create a gloriously engaging and terrifying narrative. Based on the historical details of Charles Dickens's life and narrated by Wilkie Collins (Dickens's friend, frequent collaborator, and Salieri-style secret rival), DROOD explores the still-unsolved mysteries of the famous author's last years and may provide the key to Dickens's final, unfinished work: The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Chilling, haunting, and utterly original, DROOD is Dan Simmons at his powerful best.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Dan Simmons\Drood (1517)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:42:13+02:00","epub","9780316007030","1517","isbn:9780316007030","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","Back Bay Books","3","","1.0","673807","General, Fiction, Thrillers, Historical, American Mystery & Suspense Fiction, Fiction - Espionage, thriller, History, Historical - General, American Historical Fiction, London (England), Dickens; Charles;, Biographical, Biographical fiction, 1812-1870, 19th century","Drood","Drood","53a3e2d7-e58c-400f-aefb-a8df1d23c241"

Now he offers us a superb quintet of novellas -- five dazzling masterworks of speculative fiction, including ""Orphans of the Helix,"" his award-winning return to the Hyperion Universe -- that demonstrates the unique mastery, breathtaking invention, and flawless craftsmanship of one of contemporary fiction's true greats.   Human colonists seeking something other than godhood encounter their long-lost ""cousins""...and an ancient scourge.   A devastated man in suicide's embrace is caught up in a bizarre cat-and-mouse game with a young woman possessing a world-ending power.   The distant descendants of a once-oppressed people learn a chilling lesson about the persistence of the past.   A terrifying ascent up the frigid, snow-swept slopes of K2 shatters preconceptions and reveals the true natures of four climbers, one of whom is not human.   At the intersection of a grand past and a threadbare present, an aging American in Russia confronts his own mortality as he glimpses a wondrous future.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Dan Simmons\Worlds enough & time_ five tales of (1523)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:42:14+02:00","epub","9780060506049","1523","isbn:9780060506049","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","New York : EOS, 2002.","4","","1.0","249316","Science fiction, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science fiction; American, Short Stories, Science Fiction - Short Stories","Worlds enough & time: five tales of speculative fiction","Worlds enough & time: five tales of speculative fiction","41aa9b98-5517-4e8c-bd2b-e2a2444169ea"

"Simak, Clifford D","Clifford D Simak","SUMMARY: A classic tale from one of science fiction's most creative forces. Suddenly, strange things begin to happen. World industries collaspe.

"Shiner, Lewis","Lewis Shiner","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  ""Black & White, as the title suggests, is painted on a broad canvas of stark contrasts and big themes, but the book doesn't suffer under the weight of its ambition....The novel's mere existence is proof that Shiner means it--and that readers ignore him at their peril.""  --Los Angeles Times    When Michael follows his dying father to North Carolina, a lifetime of lies begins to unravel. His pursuit of his father's past--haunted by voodoo, adultery and murder--takes him to a place called Hayti, once the most prosperous black community in the South.  Now the mysteries of Michael's own heritage become a matter of life and death, as racial conflicts barely restrained since the 1960s erupt again.    Rooted in the true story of the US government's urban renewal policy and its disastrous aftermath, Black & White is a literary thriller, a family saga, and a searing portrait of institutionalized hatred.    ""A stunning tapestry that captures the hopes, dreams, greed, bigotry, ambitions and betrayals that shaped [the characters'] destinies and those of our country.""  --Publishers Weekly","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Lewis Shiner\Black & White (1588)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:42:24+02:00","epub","9781596063037","1588","isbn:9781596063037","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","Subterranean Press","","","1.0","405889","General, Fiction, Fiction - General, Thrillers, Fiction : General, Cultural Heritage","Black & White","Black & White","45d0e0f4-7ead-492d-8b43-1763e63c7173"

Now he extends his reach into Larry Niven territory, returning to the same distant future in which Ventus was set, but employing a broader canvas.nbsp;  Lady of Mazes isnbsp;the story of Teven Coronal, a ringworld with a huge multiplicity of human civilizations. It's the story of what happens when the delicate balance of coexisting worlds is completely destroyed, when the fabric of realitynbsp;itself is torn. nbsp; Brilliant but troubled Livia Kodaly is Teven's only hope against invaders both human and superhuman whonbsp;threaten thenbsp;fragile ecologies and human diversity. Filled with action, ideas, and intellectual energy, Lady of Mazes is the hard SF novel of the year.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Karl Schroeder\Lady of mazes (1653)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:42:35+02:00","epub","9780765350787","1653","isbn:9780765350787","","Calibre Library","2006-06-27T01:00:00+02:00","New York : Tor, 2006.","4","","1.0","301805","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, High Tech, Space Opera, Adventure, Human-alien encounters, Life on other planets","Lady of mazes","Lady of mazes","683fb1c2-4689-4194-af99-1f3d804854f4"

"Scalzi, John B.","John Scalzi","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  The Ghost Brigades are the Special Forces of the Colonial Defense Forces, elite troops created from the DNA of the dead and turned into the perfect soldiers for the CDF's toughest operations. They’re young, they’re fast and strong, and they’re totally without normal human qualms.    The universe is a dangerous place for humanity—and it's about to become far more dangerous. Three races that humans have clashed with before have allied to halt our expansion into space. Their linchpin: the turncoat military scientist Charles Boutin, who knows the CDF’s biggest military secrets. To prevail, the CDF must find out why Boutin did what he did.     Jared Dirac is the only human who can provide answers -- a superhuman hybrid, created from Boutin's DNA, Jared’s brain should be able to access Boutin's electronic memories. But when the memory transplant appears to fail, Jared is given to the Ghost Brigades.     At first, Jared is a perfect soldier, but as Boutin’s memories slowly surface, Jared begins to intuit the reason’s for Boutin’s betrayal. As Jared desperately hunts for his ""father,"" he must also come to grips with his own choices. Time is running out: The alliance is preparing its offensive, and some of them plan worse things than humanity’s mere military defeat…","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\John Scalzi\The Ghost Brigades (1665)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:42:37+02:00","epub","9780765354068","1665","isbn:9780765354068","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","Tor Science Fiction","4","","1.0","267351","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, General & Literary Fiction, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Modern fiction","The Ghost Brigades","Ghost Brigades, The","98cec6f0-e58c-4c22-9532-46e6731102de"

Caitlin Decter is young, pretty, feisty, a genius at math-and blind. Still, she can surf the net with the best of them, following its complex paths clearly in her mind. But Caitlin's brain long ago co-opted her primary visual cortex to help her navigate online. So when she receives an implant to restore her sight, instead of seeing reality, the landscape of the World Wide Web explodes into her consciousness, spreading out all around her in a riot of colors and shapes. While exploring this amazing realm, she discovers something-some ""other""-lurking in the background.

Thirty-eight years later, a second message is received and Sarah, now 87, may hold the key to deciphering this one, too . . . if she lives long enough.        A wealthy industrialist offers to pay for Sarah to have a rollback—a hugely expensive experimental rejuvenation procedure. She accepts on condition that Don, her husband of sixty years, gets a rollback, too. The process works for Don, making him physically twenty-five again. But in a tragic twist, the rollback fails for Sarah, leaving her in her eighties.         While Don tries to deal with his newfound youth and the suddenly vast age gap between him and his wife, Sarah struggles to do again what she’d done once before: figure out what a signal from the stars contains. Exploring morals and ethics on both human and cosmic scales, *Rollback *is the big new SF novel for 2007 by Hugo and Nebula Award-winner Robert J. Sawyer.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Robert J.

"Rubin, Gretchen","Gretchen Rubin","Gretchen Rubin had an epiphany one rainy afternoon in the unlikeliest of places: a city bus. ""The days are long, but the years are short,"" she realized. ""Time is passing, and I'm not focusing enough on the things that really matter."" In that moment, she decided to dedicate a year to her happiness project. 
In this lively and compelling account, Rubin chronicles her adventures during the twelve months she spent test-driving the wisdom of the ages, current scientific research, and lessons from popular culture about how to be happier. Among other things, she found that novelty and challenge are powerful sources of happiness; that money can help buy happiness, when spent wisely; that outer order contributes to inner calm; and that the very smallest of changes can make the biggest difference.
### From Publishers Weekly
 **Starred Review**. Rubin is not an unhappy woman: she has a loving husband, two great kids and a writing career in New York City. Still, she could-and, arguably, should-be happier. Thus, her methodical (and bizarre) happiness project: spend one year achieving careful, measurable goals in different areas of life (marriage, work, parenting, self-fulfillment) and build on them cumulatively, using concrete steps (such as, in January, going to bed earlier, exercising better, getting organized, and ""acting more energetic""). By December, she's striving bemusedly to keep increasing happiness in every aspect of her life. The outcome is good, not perfect (in accordance with one of her ""Secrets of Adulthood"": ""Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good""), but Rubin's funny, perceptive account is both inspirational and forgiving, and sprinkled with just enough wise tips, concrete advice and timely research (including all those other recent books on happiness) to qualify as self-help. Defying self-help expectations, however, Rubin writes with keen senses of self and narrative, balancing the personal and the universal with a light touch. Rubin's project makes curiously compulsive reading, which is enough to make any reader happy. 
### Review
“An enlightening, laugh-aloud read. . . . Filled with open, honest glimpses into [Rubin’s] real life, woven together with constant doses of humor.” (Terry Hong, Christian Science Monitor )  

“For those who generally loathe the self-help genre, Rubin’s book is a breath of peppermint-scented air. Well-researched and sharply written. . . . Rubin takes an orderly, methodical approach to forging her own path to a happier state of mind.” (Kim Crow, Cleveland Plain Dealer )  

“Practical and never preachy . . . the rare self-help tome that doesn’t feel shameful to read.” (Daily Beast )  

“Packed with fascinating facts about the science of happiness and rich examples of how she improves her life through changes small and big The Happiness Project made me happier by just reading it.” (Amy Scribner, Bookpage )

As a class 9 empath with advanced biogenetic augmentations, she has complete mental and physical control of her body, and can read other people’s intentions before they can even think them. Ahni soon finds though, that there are deceptions behind deceptions, and in the middle of it lies the fate of her brother. Earth is in the midst of a political struggle between the World Council, which governs humankind, and the Platforms, which orbit high above Earth. On the Platform New York Up, “upsider” life is different. They have their own culture, values, and ambitions--and now they want their independence from Earth. One upsider leader, Dane Nilson, is determined to accomplish this goal, but he has a secret, one that could condemn him to death. When Ahni stumbles upon Dane during her quest for vengeance, her fate becomes inextricably linked to his. Together they must delve beyond the intrigue and manipulative schemes to get to the core of truth; a truth that will shape the future of the Platforms and shatter any preconceived notions of what defines the human race.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Mary Rosenblum\Horizons (1797)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:43:06+02:00","epub","9780765355157","1797","isbn:9780765355157","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","Tor Science Fiction","4","","1.0","405397","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Adventure, Science Fiction - Adventure, Science Fiction And Fantasy","Horizons","Horizons","74a2737c-6bdb-43b9-9abc-99a954e7ee8a"

"Robinson, Spider","Spider Robinson","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  After the shattering death of his beloved wife, aging baby-boomer Russell Walker had wanted only to hide from the world in the woods of British Columbia. Instead, an old college acquaintance called Smelly, who was a telepath, had knocked on his door and demanded his help in stopping a serial killer who made Hannibal Lector look like a boy scout. They had managed to convince Nika, a hard-headed and skeptical police officer, and the trio had stopped the killer, though nearly at the cost of their own lives, and things could go back to normal . . . they thought.       But then Russell was visited by his estranged son, Jesse, a PR exec from New York, still angry over his father’s role in his mother’s death. And, to their dismay, Nika and Russell learn that agreeing to help Zudie conceal the fact that he can read minds involves committing to help him hide from the CIA, who have been hunting him desperately ever since he escaped from the MK Ultra Project back in the 60s. Constable Nika must decide what being a peace officer means. Russell must decide on the fly whether or not Smelly is the kind of friend you'd die for. And Jesse, who lives in America, must decide just where his own national--and personal--loyalties lie.       Best-selling and award-winning author of *The Martian Child* **David Gerrold** says of *Very Hard Choices*, “Spider Robinson is at his best when he is most passionate—and this is Spider Robinson at his very best. If you're expecting a nice polite distraction that you can put down and forget, you're going to be very annoyed. This isn't a story, it's a wake-up call. And it isn't over until you decide it's over.”","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Spider Robinson\Very Hard Choices (1813)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:43:09+02:00","epub","9781416555568","1813","isbn:9781416555568","","Calibre Library","2008-06-14T21:30:00+02:00","Baen","4","","1.0","214277","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Space Opera, Adventure, Science Fiction - Adventure, Science Fiction - Space Opera, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Thrillers, British Columbia, Police, Mystery & Detective, Psychics, Widowers, Detective and mystery stories, Suspense fiction, Police - British Columbia","Very Hard Choices","Very Hard Choices","92dc43b6-6ea4-424a-b409-e9c7a88f96cd"

"Roberts, Keith","Keith Roberts","SUMMARY: An ever-expanding subgenre of science fiction is devoted to ""alternate worlds"" or ""alternate histories"": fiction in which a crucial event goes differently than in the world we know, and history is changed. Keith Roberts's Pavane (1968) is set in a backward 20th century molded by the assassination of Queen Elizabeth I and the triumph of a militantly antiscience Catholic Church. This is a classic alternate history, in the same company as such highly regarded novels as L. Sprague De Camp's seminal Lest Darkness Fall (1941), in which a modern man slips back in time and attempts to avert the Dark Ages; Ward Moore's Bring the Jubilee (1953), set after the South wins the U.S. Civil War; and Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle (1962), set after the Germans and Japanese win World War II. Lest Darkness Fall and The Man in the High Castle are justly famous; the other two classics, Bring the Jubilee and Pavane, are less well known, and that is a shame. One reason for Pavane's relative obscurity among American SF readers might be its British setting and author (the Moore and Dick novels are both set in the U.S., and De Camp, Moore, and Dick were all American). Another reason might be that Pavane is a novel created from interrelated but standalone stories (six ""measures,"" or novelettes, and a coda), and the stories are of varying quality. Most are wise, beautifully written, and intensely visualized, especially the opener, ""The Lady Margaret,"" and the closer, ""Corfe Gate""; but ""Brother John,"" the story of the monk-artist who witnesses Inquisition tortures and sparks an anti-Church rebellion, is far less detailed, and sometimes even unclear. Another reason for the novel's obscurity may be that some of the stories/chapters have more of a fantasy feel than is typical of more recent alternate history. Also, the nature of the coda's revelations may put off some readers. Nonetheless, Pavane is an intelligent, powerful, and moving work, deserving of a wide readership. --Cynthia Ward","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Keith Roberts\Pavane (1830)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:43:14+02:00","epub","9780575061033","1830","isbn:9780575061033","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","Victor Gollancz","4","","1.0","337010","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Fantasy, English fiction, English Science Fiction And Fantasy, 20th century","Pavane","Pavane","b014dca9-1df7-4a7b-8e74-3bcb51c9d827"

It  is he who recounts Merrick's haunting tale--a tale that takes us from  the New Orleans of the past and present to the jungles of Guatemala,  from the Mayan ruins of a century ago to ancient civilizations not yet  explored.Anne Rice's richly told novel weaves an irresistible  story of two worlds: the witches' world and the vampires' world, where  magical powers and otherworldly fascinations are locked together in a  dance of seduction, death, and rebirth.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Rice, Anne\Vampire Chronicles 7_ Merrick (1846)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:43:19+02:00","epub","9780375430770","1846","isbn:9780375430770","","Calibre Library","2000-10-16T06:00:00+02:00","Random House Large Print","","Vampire Chronicles","1.0","487169","Occult, Vampires, Horror, Fiction - Horror, Fiction, Horror - General, Occult fiction, Large type books, General, General & Literary Fiction, Horror tales, Witches, New Orleans (La.), Modern & contemporary fiction (post c 1945), Guatemala - Fiction., Guatemala, New Orleans (La.) - Fiction., Vampires - Fiction.","Vampire Chronicles 7: Merrick","Vampire Chronicles 7: Merrick","98fa6795-e5d5-433d-8ad4-4a7c42c714a1"

"Anne, Rice,","Rice, Anne","SUMMARY: In her new novel, perennial bestseller Anne Rice fuses her two uniquely seductive strains of narrative -- her Vampire legend and her lore of the Mayfair witches -- to give us a world of classic deep-south luxury and ancestral secrets. Welcome to Blackwood Farm: soaring white columns, spacious drawing rooms, bright, sun-drenched gardens, and a dark strip of the dense Sugar Devil Swamp. This is the world of Quinn Blackwood, a brilliant young man haunted since birth by a mysterious doppelgänger, “Goblin,” a spirit from a dream world that Quinn can’t escape and that prevents him from belonging anywhere. When Quinn is made a Vampire, losing all that is rightfully his and gaining an unwanted immortality, his doppelgänger becomes even more vampiric and terrifying than Quinn himself. As the novel moves backwards and forwards in time, from Quinn’s boyhood on Blackwood Farm to present day New Orleans, from ancient Athens to 19th-century Naples, Quinn seeks out the legendary Vampire Lestat in the hope of freeing himself from the spectre that draws him inexorably back to Sugar Devil Swamp and the explosive secrets it holds. A story of youth and promise, of loss and the search for love, of secrets and destiny, Blackwood Farm is Anne Rice at her mesmerizing best.

Welcome back to Blackwood Farm. Here are all of the brilliantly conceived characters that make up the two worlds of vampires and witches: Mona Mayfair, who's come to the farm to die and is brought into the realm of the undead; her uncle, Julian Mayfair, guardian of the family, determined to forever torment Lestat for what he has done to Mona; Rowan Mayfair, brilliant neurosurgeon and witch, who finds herself dangerously drawn to the all-powerful Lestat; her husband, Michael Curry, hero of the Mayfair Chronicles, who seeks Lestat's help with the temporary madness of his wife; Ash Templeton, a 5,000-year-old Taltos who has taken Mona's child; and Patsy, the country-western singer, who returns to avenge her death at the hands of her son, Quinn Blackwood. Delightfully, at the book's centre is the Vampire Lestat, once the epitome of evil, now pursuing the transformation set in motion withMemnoch the Devil. He struggles with his vampirism and yearns for goodness, purity and love, as he saves Patsy's ghost from the dark realm of the Earthbound, uncovers the mystery of the Taltos and unselfishly decides the fate of his beloved Rowan Mayfair.

"Anne, Rice,","Rice, Anne","SUMMARY: In Anne Rice's extraordinary novel, the Vampire Lestat--outsides, canny monster, hero-wanderer--is at last offered the chance to be redeemed.He is brought into direct confrontation with both God and the Devil, and into the land of Death.We are in New York.  The city is blanketed in snow.  Through the whiteness Lestat is searching for Dora, the beautiful and charismatic daughter of a drug lord, the woman who arouses Lestat's tenderness as no mortal ever has.While torn between his vampire passions and his overwhelming love for Dora, Lestat is  confronted by the most dangerous of adversaries he has yet known.He is snatched from the world itself by the mysterious Memnoch, who claims to be the Devil. He is invited to be a witness at the Creation.  He is taken like the ancient prophets into the heavenly realm and is ushered into Purgatory.He must decide if he can believe in the Devil or in God.  And finally, he must decide which, if either, he will serve.In the first four Vampire Chronicles, Anne Rice summoned up for us worlds that are fantastic and distant, making them as resonant, real, and immediate as our own.  In this, her most daring and darkest novel, she takes us, with Lestat, into the mythical world that is most important to us--into the realms of our own theology.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Rice, Anne\Vampire Chronicles 5_ Memnoch the D (1851)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:43:20+02:00","epub","9780679441014","1851","isbn:9780679441014","","Calibre Library","1995-07-02T06:00:00+02:00","Knopf","","Vampire Chronicles","1.0","482106","Vampires, Horror, Horror & ghost stories, Fiction, Horror fiction, General, Lestat (Fictitious character), Science fiction, Juvenile Fiction","Vampire Chronicles 5: Memnoch the Devil","Vampire Chronicles 5: Memnoch the Devil","b3c3bf22-b99e-46c0-9131-2e42d137bea0"
"Anne, Rice,","Rice, Anne","SUMMARY: In the best Anne Rice tradition, the great Vampire Marius returns to tell us the mesmerizing story of his life through the ages, from the time of Caesar Augustus to the present. The Vampire Marius, child of the Millenea, has lived two thousand years. He tells his story to Thorne, a lone vampire who was a Viking in a mortal life tells of his birth into the Senatorial Class at the time of Caesar Augustus, and how he was transformed into a ""dark god"" by Druids in the forests of Gaul; how he created the Vampire Armand and became guardian of Akasha and Enkil, the Queen and the King of Vampires, who hold within themselves the secret core of the life of the undead ""destroy them and you destroy all vampires."" He relates how he became the voice of reason among the vampires, and how he created Pandora, the vampire he still grieves for... We see Marius as a mortal boy in the teeming streets of second-century Rome, and in young manhood in the time of Constantine and his battle to save Rome from the Visigoths. We follow him through the Dark Ages and the Black Death, and through another thousand years to Venice and to Florence, where he seeks out the great Botticelli and becomes a painter, working in a glorious palazzo a blood drinker in the thick of a rich and brilliant mortal life. Worlds within worlds unfold historic, fantastic, cultural, vampiric, from the London of Henry VIII to 17th-century Paris and Weimar as the novel moves to its splendid finale in an Aegean kingdom ruled by the great vampire: the magician Marius.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Rice, Anne\Vampire Chronicles 8_ Blood and Gol (1852)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:43:20+02:00","epub","9780676974386","1852","isbn:9780676974386","","Calibre Library","2001-03-14T06:00:00+02:00","Knopf Canada","","Vampire Chronicles","1.0","574011","Occult, Vampires, Horror, Fiction, Horror - General, Horror fiction, Occult fiction; American, Europe, Horror tales; American, Immortality","Vampire Chronicles 8: Blood and Gold","Vampire Chronicles 8: Blood and Gold","dc0f23fd-95fd-4d23-a652-a3e539d9735c"
"Anne, Rice,","Rice, Anne","SUMMARY: In the latest installment of The Vampire Chronicles, Anne Rice summons up dazzling worlds to bring us the story of Armand--eternally young, with the face of a Botticelli angel. Armand, who first appeared in all his dark glory more than twenty years ago in the now-classicInterview with the Vampire, the first of The Vampire Chronicles, the novel that established its author worldwide as a magnificent storyteller and creator of magical realms. Now, we go with Armand across the centuries to the Kiev Rus of his boyhood--a ruined city under Mongol dominion--and to ancient Constantinople, where Tartar raiders sell him into slavery. And in a magnificent palazzo in the Venice of the Renaissance we see him emotionally and intellectually in thrall to the great vampire Marius, who masquerades among humankind as a mysterious, reclusive painter and who will bestow upon Armand the gift of vampiric blood. As the novel races to its climax, moving through scenes of luxury and elegance, of ambush, fire, and devil worship to nineteenth-century Paris and today's New Orleans, we see its eternally vulnerable and romantic hero forced to choose between his twilight immortality and the salvation of his immortal soul.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Rice, Anne\Vampire Chronicles 6_ The Vampire A (1853)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:43:20+02:00","epub","9780679454472","1853","isbn:9780679454472","","Calibre Library","1998-10-09T06:00:00+02:00","Alfred A.

"Anne, Rice,","Rice, Anne","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Returning to the hypnotic world she so brilliantly created in **Interview with the Vampire**, Anne Rice demonstrates once again her power to enthrall.  With the same richness of drama, atmosphere and incident, she tells the fantastic story of the vampire Lestat, whom we first perceived as the seductive devil-vampire of **Interview with the Vampire** and whom we now follow through the ages as he searches for the origin and meaning of his own dark immortality.  And who, more and more, engages our sympathy until he stands revealed as a questing romantic, a vampire-hero with his own strange and passionate courage and morality.As the novel opens, Lestat, having risen from the earth after a fifty-five years' sleep,  and infatuated with the modern world, presents himself in all his vampire brilliance as a rock star, a superstar, a seducer of millions.  And, in this blaze of adulation, daring to break the vampire oath of silence, he determines to tell his story, to rouse the generations of the living dead from their slumbers and to penetrate the riddle of his own existence.As he speaks we are plunged back into eighteenth-century France, into the castle where we meet the young Lestat: child of impoverished aristocrats, heroic hunter of wolves, at odds with his tyrannical father, running away to join a traveling troupe of actors.  We see him in the licentious Paris of the day, first apprentice at a boulevard theater, then its most celebrated actor, idolized, adored by many and--night after night--watched by one . . . until, in a sleep filled with dreams of the wolves he killed as a boy, he is shocked awake by a dark figure and suddenly, horribly, eternally joined to the unholy brotherhood.We follow Lestat as he searches for others like him--in churches and brothels, in gambling houses, huts and palaces--sometimes joined by the vampire-angel Gabrielle, who is bound to him both by blood and by passion; sometimes traveling with his adored Nicolas, the violinist whose music and beauty are equally transcendent.  We follow Lestat as he travels from the snowcapped mountains of the Auvergne and the primeval forest of ancient Gaul to Sicily, Istanbul, Venice and Cairo, searching for his origins, sometimes finding clues to the birth of the vampire race, knowing always that the central truth eludes him.But all the while, throughout his travels, through many lands and many times, Lestat has made enemies among his brethren--vampires who are in terror of his questions, who fear he will disturb the uneasy balance in which they exist with the mortal world, and who suspect in him a desire to rule.  And when, in the caves below a craggy Greek island, in a sanctuary whose walls are covered with gold-flecked murals, the very first of the living dead awake, the truth at the heart of his quest is at last revealed.  Ancient forces held immobile through the ages are irreversibly set in motion, and as the novel rushes to its stunning climax, Lestat's vampire foes converge in pursuit of him on the demonic freeways of the twentieth century.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Rice, Anne\Vampire Chronicles 2_ The vampire L (1856)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:43:21+02:00","epub","9780394534435","1856","isbn:9780394534435","","Calibre Library","1985-09-11T06:00:00+02:00","Knopf","","Vampire Chronicles","1.0","621588","Vampires, Horror, Fiction - Horror, Horror & ghost stories, Fiction, Horror - General, Horror fiction, General, Lestat (Fictitious character), General & Literary Fiction, Horror tales, Modern fiction, Supernatural, Comics & Graphic Novels","Vampire Chronicles 2: The vampire Lestat","Vampire Chronicles 2: The vampire Lestat","64645418-3620-4443-84de-d4e821553740"

"Reynolds, Mack","Mack Reynolds","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  When a man has a great deal of knowledge, it becomes extremely easy for him to confuse ""knowledge"" with ""wisdom"" ... and forget that the antonym of ""wisdom"" is not ""ignorant"" but ""folly."" Forward: Hardly had man solved his basic problems on the planet of his origin than he began to jumble into space. Barely a century had elapsed in the exploration of the Solar System than he began to grope for the stars.And suddenly, with an all but religious zeal, mankind conceived its fantasy dream of populating the galaxy, Never in the history of the race had fervor reached such a peak and held so long. The question of why was seemingly ignored. Millions of Earth-t)pe planets beckoned and with a lemming-like desperation humanity erupted into them.      But the obstacles were frightening in their magnitude. The planets and satellites of Sol had proven comparatively tractable and those that were suited to man-life were quickly brought under his dominion. But there, of course, he had the advantage of proximity. The time involved in running back and forth to the home planet was meaningless and all Earth's resources could be thrown into each problem's solving.   But a planet a year removed in transportation or even communication? Ay! this was another thing and more than once a million colonists were lost before the Earthlings could adapt to new climates, new flora and fauna, new bacteria-or to factors which the most far out visionary had never fancied, perhaps the lack of something never before missed.   So, mad with the lust to seed the universe with his kind, men sought new methods. To a hundred thousand worlds they sent smaller colonies, as few as a hundred pioneers apiece, and there marooned them, to adapt, if adapt they could.   For a millennium each colony was left to its own resources, to conquer the environment or to perish in the effort.   A thousand years was sufficient. Invariably it was found, on those planets where human life survived at all, man slipped back during his first two or three centuries into a state of barbarism. Then slowly began to inch forward again. There were exceptions and the progress on one planet never exactly duplicated that on another, however the average ivas surprisingly close to both nadir and zenith, in terms of evolution of society.   In a thousand years it was deemed by the Office of Galactic Colonization such pioneers had largely adjusted to the new environment and were ready for civilization, industrialization and eventual assimilation into the rapidly evolving Galactic Commonwealth.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Mack Reynolds\Adaptation (1859)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:43:21+02:00","epub","9781437836295","1859","isbn:9781437836295","","Calibre Library","2008-08-30T01:00:00+02:00","IndyPublish.com","","","1.0","87921","General, Fiction, General & Literary Fiction, Fiction - General, Modern fiction, Modern & contemporary fiction (post c 1945)","Adaptation","Adaptation","e7433403-8c9a-4341-ab5b-322136933ec6"

"Unknown","Kamal Ravikant","In December of 2011, I gave a talk to an audience of scientists, Pentagon officials, politicians, and CEOs on the secret of life and how I'd figured it out the previous summer. Afterwards, people came up individually and told me how much what I'd shared meant to them. This book is based on the truth I spoke about. It's something I learned from within myself, something I believed saved me. And more than that, the way I set about to do it. This is a collection of thoughts on what I learned, what worked, what didn't. Where I succeed and importantly, where I fail daily. The truth is to love yourself with the same intensity you would use to pull yourself up if you were hanging off a cliff with your fingers. As if your life depended upon it. Once you get going, it's not hard to do. Just takes commitment and I'll share how I did it. It's been transformative for me. I know it will be transformative for you as well.
### About the Author
I've been fortunate enough to have some amazing experiences in my life so far. I've trekked to one of the highest base camps in the Himalayas, meditated with Tibetan monks in the Dalai Lama's monastery, earned my US Army Infantry patch, walked 550 miles across Spain, lived in Paris, been the only non-black, non-woman member of the Black Women's writers' group, written a novel, held the hands of dying patients, and worked with some of the best people in Silicon Valley. But the most transformative experience has been the simple act of loving myself.

"Priest, Christopher","Christopher Priest","SUMMARY: THE SEPARATION is the story of twin brothers. Rowers in the 1936 Olympics, they meet Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy; one joins the RAF, and captains a Wellington; he is shot down after a bombing raid on Hamburg and become's Churchill's aide-de-camp; his twin brother, a pacifist, works with the Red Cross, rescuing bombing victims in London. But this is not a straightforward story of the Second World War: this is an alternate history: the two brothers - both called J.L. Sawyer - live their lives in alternate versions of reality. In one, the Second World War ends as we imagine it did; in the other, thanks to efforts of an eminent team of negotiators headed by Hess, the war ends in 1941. THE SEPARATION is an emotionally riveting story of how ordinary people can make a difference; it's a savage critique of Winston Churchill, the man credited as the saviour of Britain and the Western World, and it's a story of how one perceives and shapes the past. THE SEPARATION was originally published by Simon & Schuster as a trade paperback, with a very small print run; it went out of print almost immediately and was never reprinted. Gollancz will publish initially as a price-promoted hardcover, as a platform for reviews and national newspaper coverage, prior to lead title paperback publication in 2004.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Christopher Priest\The Separation (2122)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:44:21+02:00","epub","9780575070028","2122","isbn:9780575070028","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","Victor Gollancz","4","","1.0","333953","General, Fiction, Fantasy, Modern fiction","The Separation","Separation, The","4f9cf5db-4b00-4510-a563-e02770c6e93d"

I've heard it said that God made all men, but Samuel Colt made all men equal. We'd see what Mr. Colt could do for a woman. Jack Gabert went to India to serve his Queen. He returned to London a violently changed man, infected with an unnatural sickness that altered his body and warped his mind. Eileen Callaghan left an Irish convent with a revolver and a secret. She knows everything and nothing about Jack's curse, but she cannot rest until he's caught. His soul cannot be saved. It can only be returned to God. In the years following the American Civil War, the nun and unnatural creature stalk one another across the United States. Their dangerous game of cat and mouse leads them along great rivers, across dusty plains, and into the no man's land of the unmarked western territories. Here are three tales of the hunt. Reader, take this volume and follow these tormented souls. Learn what you can from their struggle's against each other, against God, and against themselves.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Cherie Priest\Dreadful Skin (2123)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:44:22+02:00","epub","9781596061910","2123","isbn:9781596061910","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","Far Territories","4","","1.0","176723","Fiction, Fantasy, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Horror, Historical, Horror - General, Fiction - Horror, Graphic Novels: General, Graphic novels, Fantasy - Historical","Dreadful Skin","Dreadful Skin","38e9dc80-9694-4d63-88b6-76d746acbf5c"

"Preuss, Paul","Paul Preuss","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  **the fifth volume in a series of science-fiction thrillers evolving from the works of arthur c. clarke, grandmaster of science fiction and author of 2001: a space odyssey.**    Her code name is Sparta. Her beauty veils a mysterious past and abilities of superhuman dimension -- the product of advanced biotechnology.    Much excitement has arisen throughout the galaxy over the exploration mission to Jupiter's moon, Amalthea. Led by the renowned Professor J.Q.R. Forster, the dangerous expedition will lead its members to the surface of this strange moon -- and beyond. It is Sparta's mission to monitor the trip on the part of the Board of Space Control.     Her task becomes more threatening when Sir Randolph Mays, Forster's rival and nemesis, ""accidentally"" crash-lands on Amalthea's surface. Far from innocent, Mays has a plan for laying claim to Forster's discoveries, and only Sparta is able to prevent sabotage. But what is Mays really after? And how will they all react to the discovery of an alien life-form...?    This breathtaking adventure brings together the genius of Arthur C. Clarke and the talents of distinguished science-fiction writer Paul Preuss.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Paul Preuss\The Diamond Moon (Arthur C.

"Preston, Douglas J.","Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child","SUMMARY: For generations, treasure hunters have tried to unlock the deadly puzzle known as the Water Pit: a labyrinth of shafts and tunnels that honeycombs the heart of a small island off the coast of Maine. Reputed to be the hiding place of pirate treasure, the Water Pit possesses an inexplicable ability to kill those who venture into it, from professionals to innocent explorers. But now one man has made a startling discovery: The Water Pit is actually a carefully designed fortress, conceived for pirates by a renowned seventeenth-century architect who hid his plans in code. Unlocking the code will break the curse of the Water Pit. Or will it? The most comprehensive, high-tech expedition ever assembled has come to Maine and to Dr. Malin Hatch, owner of the island. While the treasure hunters have their reasons for mounting this assault--$2 billion in gold--Hatch has his own motives to join them. For Hatch, whose brother died on Ragged Island thirty years before, the only escape from the curse is through the black swirling waters and bloodstained chambers of the Pit. With more computing power than a small university, the recovery team slowly chips away at the mystery. But as the seekers try to conquer the Pit, men begin to die. Hatch is confronted with his childhood memories of the tragedy even as he is drawn into a complex relationship with a beautiful French diver. All the while, the last, secret chamber of the Pit waits to unleash the most lethal mystery of all. . . .A thriller of the highest order, Riptide is an extraordinary novel of obsession, courage, and adventure. With each nerve-racking page we are swept into the mystery and the challenge of Ragged Island and forced to face the haunting question: Is the Water Pit a gateway to limitless treasure--or to hell itself?","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Douglas Preston\Riptide (2127)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:44:22+02:00","epub","9780446607179","2127","isbn:9780446607179","","Calibre Library","1999-07-01T01:00:00+02:00","Warner Books","4","","1.0","415128","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Adventure, Suspense, Thrillers, Fiction - Espionage, thriller, Adventure fiction, Mystery, Modern & contemporary fiction (post c 1945), Crime & mystery, Maine, Treasure troves, Treasure troves - Maine, Treasure-trove","Riptide","Riptide","ed055901-599c-435a-a03c-e0450d6cb1af"

Two decades later, in 1963, he will be forced to confront again the nightmarethat has haunted his adult life: a lethal unfinished operation code-named Declare. From the corridors of Whitehall to the Arabian desert, from post-war Berlin to the streets of Cold War Moscow, Hale's desperate quest draws him into international politics and gritty espionage tradecraft -- and inexorably drives Hale, the fiery and beautiful Communist agent Elena Teresa Ceniza-Bendiga, and Kim Philby, mysterious traitor to the British cause, to a deadly confrontation on the high glaciers of Mount Ararat, in the very shadow of the fabulous and perilous Ark.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Tim Powers\Declare (2174)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:44:35+02:00","epub","9780380798360","2174","isbn:9780380798360","","Calibre Library","2002-03-15T02:00:00+02:00","HarperTorch","4","","1.0","531673","General, Fiction, Fantasy, Fantasy - General, Epic, Suspense, Thrillers, Fiction - Espionage, thriller, Espionage, History, 20th century, Intelligence officers, Spy stories, Intrigue, Cold War, Modern, Paris (France)","Declare","Declare","093deb36-9860-4a9b-baa8-d6aa0f6e70bc"

"Pollack, Rachel","Rachel Pollack","SUMMARY: When I was fourteen, a cousin of mine angered a Malignant One. It was a big case, a genuine scandal. Maybe you remember it. At the time, when it ended, I just wanted to forget about the whole thing. But a couple of years have passed and I guess maybe it's time to think about it again. Thus begins Ellen Pierson's story of how she helped her cousin Paul contend with the Malignant One running a temp agency in the office building where he worked. Ellen's story is a bright and moving tale set in the same fabulous, fantastic America as that of Rachel Pollack's award-winning Unquenchable Fire. Funny and frantic, poignant and powerful, Temporary Agency is an enduring fable from a writer whose work, in the words of Orson Scott Card, ""like a river in flood, resists the well-channeled ways, cutting its own channel through the fictional terrain.""","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Rachel Pollack\Temporary Agency (2184)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:44:37+02:00","epub","9780879516024","2184","isbn:9780879516024","","Calibre Library","1995-10-04T01:00:00+02:00","Overlook TP","","","1.0","147986","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fantasy, Fantasy - General, Fiction - Fantasy, Science Fiction - Anthologies","Temporary Agency","Temporary Agency","e0206e4c-dfc0-45ff-a27f-187ebe3b63f0"

"Pohl, Frederik","Frederik Pohl","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  ***             Just as medicine is not a science, but rather              an art-a device, practised in a scientific manner,              in its best manifestations-time-travel stories              are not science fiction. Time-travel, however,              has become acceptable to science fiction readers              as a traditional device in stories than are              otherwise admissible in the genre. Here, Frederik              Pohl employs it to portray the amusingly              catastrophic meeting of three societies.***   excerpt from the introductory: I - Foraminifera 9   Paptaste udderly, semped sempsemp dezhavoo, qued schmerz-Excuse me. I mean to say that it was like an endless diet of days, boring, tedious....   No, it loses too much in the translation. Explete my reasons, I say. Do my reasons matter? No, not to you, for you are troglodytes, knowing nothing of causes, understanding only acts. Acts and facts, I will give you acts and facts.   First you must know how I am called. My ""name"" is Foraminifera 9-Hart Bailey's Beam, and I am of adequate age and size. (If you doubt this, I am prepared to fight.) Once the-the tediety of life, as you might say, had made itself clear to me, there were, of course, only two alternatives. I do not like to die, so that possibility was out; and the remaining alternative was flight.   Naturally, the necessary machinery was available to me. I arrogated a small viewing machine, and scanned the centuries of the past in the hope that a sanctuary might reveal itself to my aching eyes. Kwel tediety that was! Back, back I went through the ages. Back to the Century of the Dog, back to the Age of the Crippled Men. I found no time better than my own. Back and back I peered, back as far as the Numbered Years. The Twenty-Eighth Century was boredom unendurable, the Twenty-Sixth a morass of dullness. Twenty-Fifth, Twenty-Fourth-wherever I looked, tediety was what I found.      I snapped off the machine and considered. Put the problem thus: Was there in all of the pages of history no age in which a 9-Hart Bailey's Beam might find adventure and excitement? There had to be! It was not possible, I told myself, despairing, that from the dawn of the dreaming primates until my own time there was no era at all in which I could be-happy? Yes, I suppose happiness is what I was looking for. But where was it? In my viewer, I had fifty centuries or more to look back upon. And that was, I decreed, the trouble; I could spend my life staring into the viewer, and yet never discover the time that was right for me. There were simply too many eras to choose from. It was like an enormous library in which there must, there had to be, contained the one fact I was looking for-that, lacking an index, I might wear my life away and never find.

But even as he gambles on the breakthrough technology, he is wracked with the guilt of losing his wife, poised forever at the ""event horizon"" of a black hole where Robin had abaondoned her.

He's hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, and like many kids with AS, Jacob has a special focus on one subject -- in his case, forensic analysis.

But then his town is rocked by a terrible murder and, for a change, the police come to Jacob with questions. All of the hallmark behaviors of Asperger's -- not looking someone in the eye, stimulatory tics and twitches, flat affect -- can look a lot like guilt to law enforcement personnel. Suddenly, Jacob and his family, who only want to fit in, feel the spotlight shining directly on them. For his mother, Emma, it's a brutal reminder of the intolerance and misunderstanding that always threaten her family. For his brother, Theo, it's another indication of why nothing is normal because of Jacob. And over this small family the soul-searing question looms: Did Jacob commit murder? Emotionally powerful from beginning to end, *House Rules* looks at what it means to be different in our society, how autism affects a family, and how our legal system works well for people who communicate a certain way -- and fails those who don't.

Sixty years later, Eric starts another long journey in an America that has long since quit resembling our own, but there are shadows everywhere. Shadows of what the world once was, and shadows from Eric's past. Blood bandits, wolves, fire, feral children, and an insane militia are only a few of the problems Eric faces. Set in Denver, Colorado and the western foothills, Van Pelt's first novel is both a coming-of-age tale, and a story of an old man's search for hope in the midst of disaster. Eric's two adventures lead him through a slice of modern America and into the depths of one man's heart.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\James Van Pelt\Summer of the Apocalypse (2221)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:44:58+02:00","epub","9780974657387","2221","isbn:9780974657387","","Calibre Library","2006-11-15T02:00:00+02:00","Fairwood Press, Inc","4","","1.0","288322","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Science fiction; American, Plague, Fathers and sons","Summer of the Apocalypse","Summer of the Apocalypse","89ab2e03-fdd1-48c6-8f37-e7e70ad4c877"

"Paul, Graham Sharp","Graham Sharp Paul","SUMMARY: He thought Hell was the worst they could throw at him.He was wrong.Back from tangling with the Hammer of Kraa, the most brutal, trigger-happy tyrants in humanspace, Junior Lieutenant Michael Helfort is assigned to the Federated Worlds heavy cruiser Ishaq, which is struggling to rise to the threat posed by a newly resurgent Hammer. Aboard the floundering ship, Helfort is coming to grips with a painful injury and the unpleasant truth that nobody likes a young hero–least of all senior officers.Without warning, the Ishaq and twenty-seven Fed merchant ships are blown apart in a horrific ambush, the first step in the Hammer’s master strategy to destroy the hated Federated Worlds. Michael and a pitiful remnant of the Ishaq’s crew escape the inferno. The Feds have no idea who’s behind the heinous attack, and the Hammer are determined to keep it that way, consigning the Ishaq’s survivors to a prison camp deep in the wilderness of the Hammer’s home planet. No one’s getting out alive to derail the Hammer’s lethal master plan–especially not the FedWorlds hero who so humiliated them on the battlefield. It’s payback time, and the Hammers intend to throw their entire space fleet into destroying Michael Helfort and the Federated Worlds. Too bad it won’t be enough.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Graham Sharp Paul\Battle of the hammer worlds (2227)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:44:59+02:00","epub","9780345495723","2227","isbn:9780345495723","","Calibre Library","2008-08-26T01:00:00+02:00","New York: Del Rey/Ballantine Books, 2008.","4","","1.0","349608","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Space Opera, Science Fiction - Space Opera, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Imaginary wars and battles, Interstellar travel, Good and evil","Battle of the hammer worlds","Battle of the hammer worlds","37ae558d-d704-4c77-8440-6b2a10556365"

For Junior Lieutenant Michael Helfort and the crew aboard deep space scout vessel 387, the mission is clear: infiltrate enemy territory, locate the Mumtaz, and rescue the prisoners.The odds are appalling, and the damage will probably be fatal, but victory is nonnegotiable–especially for Helfort, whose mother and sister were on the Mumtaz.

"James, Patterson,","Patterson, James","SUMMARY: During an intimate dinner party, a cat burglar breaks into the home of A-list actor Marcus Dowling. When his wife walks in on the thief, the situation quickly teeters out of control, leaving an empty safe and a lifeless body. The same night, a woman and her infant child are ruthlessly gunned down in an abandoned garage. The killer hasn't left a shred of evidence, except for a foreboding and cryptic message: WCF, the letters written in blood-red letters. With two elusive criminals on the loose, Detective Lindsay Boxer calls on the Women's Murder Club to help her stop them before they continue their spree. But before they can break either case, the Lipstick Killer changes his act and demands a ransom--not for a single victim, but for all of San Francisco. Lindsay puts her own life on the line--but will it be enough to save the city from this deranged killer?","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Patterson, James\Womans Murder Club 9 - The 9th Judg (2254)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:45:07+02:00","epub","0316036277","2254","isbn:0316036277","","Calibre Library","2010-06-08T06:00:00+02:00","Little, Brown and Company","","","1.0","311630","","Womans Murder Club 9 - The 9th Judgment","Womans Murder Club 9 - The 9th Judgment","d4907cd4-5d68-45aa-b366-ae1a2c64243a"

Duke Valens dragged his people into the war to save the life of one woman - a woman whose husband he then killed. He regrets the evil he's done, but he, equally, had no choice. Secretary Psellus never wanted to rule the Republic, or fight a desperate siege for its survival. As a man of considerable intelligence, he knows that he has a role to play - and little choice but to accept it. The machine has been built.

On the world Lusitania there are now three sapient races-the Pequeninos, who evolved there; Humans, who came to colonize; and a Hive Queen and her children brought by Ender long years ago. But on Lusitania there is also the descolada, a virus deadly to human beings which would spread like wildfire throughout the Stairways Congress should it ever escape the planet. The Starways Congress decided that The descolada should be wiped out once and for all, and sent a fleet, armed with a planet-destroying weapon, to do it. A fourth intelligence, loyal to Ender and Lusitania caused that fleet to disappear. On a distant world called Path live a people whose culture owes much to that of ancient China on Earth. They have evolved a caste known as the godspoken, people of superior intellectual abilities who pay a terrible price for their gifts. The godspoken of Path have given their loyalty and service to the Starways Congress. Among the god spoken is a young girl named, in The language of her people, Gloriously Bright. It is to her that the Starways Congress turn with the mystery of the disappearance of the Lusitania Fleet. There is no doubt that Gloriously Bright will discover the answer to the puzzle.

When anyone with a few hundred dollars and a little ingenuity can build their own spaceship, even American citizens can't wait to get out from under the United States's domineering thumb.Trent and Donna Stinson, of Rock Springs, Wyoming, seal up their pickup for vacuum and go looking for a better life among the stars, but they soon learn that you can't outrun your problems. America's belligerent foreign policy is expanding just as fast as the world's refugees, threatening to destroy humanity's last chance for peaceful coexistence. When their own government tries to kill them for exercising the freedoms that people once took for granted, Trent and Donna reluctantly admit that America must be stopped. But how can patriotic citizens fight their own country?

Then those feline lords of creation ran into those ridiculous weed-eating pacifistic apes who called themselves humans. And the catlike Kzin found they had their collective tail caught in a meat grinder. When the mighty Kzin moved in to take over the monkey-infested worlds, they got clobbered. The humans, with their underhanded monkey cunning, turned communications equipment and space drives into weapons that cut the dauntless Kzin heroes into ribbons. And then those underhanded humans gained a faster-than-light drive, and no amount of screaming and leaping could keep the Kzin from losing their first war in centuries of successful conquest. But you can't keep a good warcat down, and the Kzin have by no means given up. New weapons, new strategies, and new leaders. Here they come again and those monkey-boys from Earth had better watch their backs.

"Niven, Larry","Larry Niven","SUMMARY: ""Niven has come up with an idea about as far out as one can get. . . . This is certainly classic science fictionthe idea is truly the hero."" Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine When leaving Earth, the crew of the spaceship Discipline was prepared for a routine assignment. Dispatched by the all-powerful State on a mission of interstellar exploration and colonization, Discipline was aided (and secretly spied upon) by Sharls Davis Kendy, an emotionless computer intelligence programmed to monitor the loyalty and obedience of the crew. But what they weren't prepared for was the smoke ringan immense gaseous envelope that had formed around a neutron star directly in their path. The Smoke Ring was home to a variety of plant and animal life-forms evolved to thrive in conditions of continual free-fall. When Discipline encountered it, something went wrong. The crew abandoned ship and fled to the unlikely space oasis. Five hundred years later, the descendants of the Discipline crew living on the Smoke Ring no longer remember their origins. Earth is more myth than memory, and no recollection of the State remains. But Kendy remembers. And just outside the Smoke Ring, Discipline waits patiently to make contact with its wayward children. SUMMARY: In the free-fall environment of the Smoke Ring, the descendants of the crew of the Discipline no longer remembered their Earth roots -- or the existence of Sharls Davis Kendy, the computer-program despot of the ship. Until Kendy initiated contact once more.Fourteen years later, only Jeffer, the Citizens Tree Scientist, knew that Kendy was still watching -- and waiting. Then the Citizens Tree people rescued a family of loggers and learned for the first time of the Admiralty, a large society living in free fall amid the floating debris called the Clump. And it was likely that the Admiralty had maintained, intact, Discipline's original computer library.Exploration was a temptation neither Jeffer nor Kendy could resist, and neither Citizens Tree nor Sharls Davis Kendy would ever be the same again...","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Larry Niven\The Smoke Ring (2310)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:45:32+02:00","epub","9785551767374","2310","isbn:9785551767374","","Calibre Library","1984-03-12T02:00:00+02:00","Ballantine Books","4","","1.0","349445","Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General","The Smoke Ring","Smoke Ring, The","48381f93-14bc-4092-9d84-74dcf77287a6"

Bred to be conquering warriors, they thought the salad-munching apes of Earth wouldn't even put up a good fight. Actually, they should have been more polite to the monkey boys and girls from planet Earth. Humans had developed a pacifist society because they had been good - ""too"" good - at war and knew that there's more than one way to skin a cat - even a Kzin.

"Niven, Larry","Larry Niven & Jerry Pournelle","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Robert Heinlein called it ""possibly the finest science fiction novel I have ever read."" *The San Francisco Chronicle* declared that ""as science fiction, *The Mote in God's Eye* is one of the most important novels ever published.""  Now Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, award winning authors of such bestsellers as *Footfall *and *The Legacy of Heorot,* return us to the Mote, and to the universe of Kevin Renner and Horace Bury, of Rod Blaine and Sally Fowler.      There, 25 years have passed since humanity quarantined the mysterious aliens known as Moties within the confines of their own solar system. They have spent a quarter century analyzing and agonizing over the deadly threat posed by the only aliens mankind has ever encountered-- a race divided into distinct biological forms, each serving a different function. Master, Mediator, Engineer. Warrior. Each supremely adapted to its task, yet doomed by millions of years of evolution to an inescapable fate. For the Moties must breed-- or die.      And now the fragile wall separating them and the galaxy beyond is beginning to crumble.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Larry Niven\The gripping hand (2315)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:45:34+02:00","epub","9780671795740","2315","isbn:9780671795740","","Calibre Library","1994-01-01T02:00:00+02:00","New York : Pocket Books, [1994], c1993.","3","","1.0","428204","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Space Opera, Adventure, Fantasy, Science fiction; American, Short Stories, Romance, Historical, Romance - Historical, Romance: historical","The gripping hand","gripping hand, The","6560f54a-7389-4130-8426-2f716f926e8d"
"Niven, Larry","Larry Niven","SUMMARY: ""Niven has come up with an idea about as far out as one can get. . . . This is certainly classic science fictionthe idea is truly the hero."" Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine When leaving Earth, the crew of the spaceship Discipline was prepared for a routine assignment. Dispatched by the all-powerful State on a mission of interstellar exploration and colonization, Discipline was aided (and secretly spied upon) by Sharls Davis Kendy, an emotionless computer intelligence programmed to monitor the loyalty and obedience of the crew. But what they weren't prepared for was the smoke ringan immense gaseous envelope that had formed around a neutron star directly in their path. The Smoke Ring was home to a variety of plant and animal life-forms evolved to thrive in conditions of continual free-fall. When Discipline encountered it, something went wrong. The crew abandoned ship and fled to the unlikely space oasis. Five hundred years later, the descendants of the Discipline crew living on the Smoke Ring no longer remember their origins. Earth is more myth than memory, and no recollection of the State remains. But Kendy remembers. And just outside the Smoke Ring, Discipline waits patiently to make contact with its wayward children.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Larry Niven\The integral trees (2316)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:45:34+02:00","epub","9780345312709","2316","isbn:9780345312709","","Calibre Library","1984-03-12T02:00:00+02:00","New York : Ballantine Books, 1984, c1983.","4","","1.0","321175","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Science fiction; American, Non-Classifiable, Space colonies, Nonfiction - General, Reduced gravity environments","The integral trees","integral trees, The","ca342d4b-cca6-4b2c-897c-33b80f9bbc10"
"Niven, Larry","Larry Niven","SUMMARY: In the first book of this award-winning series, a huge architectural ring is constructed in outer space. In time it will house the inhabitants of the dying Earth. A whole new world is emerging, a world of huge dimensions, encompassing an area three million times the area of the Earth. Ringworld has a gravitational field and high walls to preserve its atmosphere. Its proximity to the sun maintains the new planet's climate. With those kinds of resources at its disposal, humankind can begin anew -- but not without meeting the disquieting challenges of a brave new world. Breath- taking ingenious from start to finish, RINGWORLD is fast becoming a science fiction classic.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Larry Niven\Ringworld (2317)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:45:34+02:00","epub","9780345306340","2317","isbn:9780345306340","","Calibre Library","2010-02-15T21:30:00+02:00","Del Rey","3","","1.0","393950","Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Non-Classifiable","Ringworld","Ringworld","0d4bac04-74d9-4096-89f4-4a24f924cb9c"
"Niven, Larry","Paul Chafe, Larry Niven","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  For fifty thousand years the Kzinti Patriarchy thrived on battle fought for conquest.  Against all odds the humans stopped them, and for five wars kept on stopping them.  With its violent expansion checked internal strains have built up within the Patriarchy, and now they threaten to tear it apart.  When the ambitious Kchula-Tzaatz makes a bid for ultimate power the established order comes tumbling down, and the flames of war burn hot in Destiny's Forge. Hammered on that Forge are; Major Quacy Tskombe, battle hardened warrior turned diplomat.  His life is duty, his mission takes him to the Citadel of the Patriarch in a last ditch effort to avert war.  When it all falls apart he's forced to choose between love and loyalty, with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance. Captain Ayla Cherenkova, starship commander.  As talented as she is beautiful, her hatred of the Kzinti has driven her to the top.   Her space combat genius is unmatched, but when she's trapped alone in the jungles of Kzinhome her survival will depend on a whole new skillset. Pouncer, First-Son-of-Meerz-Rritt, heir apparent to the galaxy's most powerful empire.  He's reduced to a nameless fugitive with the collapse of his father's dynasty.  Survival demands escape, but honor demands vengeance, and the price of his Name will be paid in the blood of worlds.  Paul Chafe presents a masterpiece in the grand tradition of epic science fiction.  No fan of Larry Niven's best-selling Known Space series can miss Destiny's Forge.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Paul Chafe, Larry Niven\Destiny's Forge (Man-Kzin Wars Seri (2318)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:45:35+02:00","epub","9781416520719","2318","isbn:9781416520719","","Calibre Library","2006-07-04T01:00:00+02:00","Baen","4","","1.0","1124275","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Space Opera, Adventure, Science Fiction - Adventure, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Science Fiction - Space Opera, Kzin (Imaginary place)","Destiny's Forge (Man-Kzin Wars Series)","Destiny's Forge (Man-Kzin Wars Series)","912279ad-48ea-4e81-8791-39973fbbcec3"

"Niven, Larry","Larry Niven, Hal Colebatch","SUMMARY: The first colonists from Earth named the planet Wunderland. Generations later, the felinoid alien invaders called Kzin came and turned it into a hell for humans. Touched on in other accounts of the Man-Kzin wars, here for the first time is the decades-long saga of Wunderland: how the Wunderlanders first learned of the Kzin attacks on Earth by slower-than-light communications, barely in time to prepare to fight back. How the valiant human defenders turned to guerilla warfare in the Wunderland jungles and caves after the feline warrior race had destroyed or seized the cities. How, after the war ended in an ignominous defeat for the Kzin, some humans and Kzin worked for good will between the two species-their work complicated by humans wanting revenge and Kzin who still saw humans as a somewhat annoying food source. And how a human-Kzin team was sent to investigate a mysterious asteroid and found a threat not only to both species, but to the entire galaxy. The humans wanted to destroy it, but the Kzin wanted to exploit it, and the only hope was a Kzin telepath raised by humans from a cub.

"Niven, Larry","Larry Niven & Jerry Pournelle","SUMMARY: Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle have created a unique and believable world set in the universe of Niven's The Magic Goes Away. The story begins nearly 14,000 years ago in Tep's Town, located on the future site of Los Angeles. Tep's Town is a city held captive by the slumbering god of fire, Yagen-Atep. Awakening only occasionally, he commands selected men to begin Burnings by giving them the ability to start fires coupled with consuming anger. Whandall Placehold grows up in the stagnant, three-class society of Tep's town, part of a gang of thieves. No one gets in or out, since the town is hemmed in by a malevolent forest. But when Whandall is chosen by Yagen-Atep to start the Burnings, he resists the compulsion and, aided by Atlantean wizard Morth, escapes through the forest with a group of children he saves from certain death. As the years pass, Whandall builds an empire, buys wagons and bison, and builds a trade route all along the California coast--except for Tep's Town. Life is good for Whandall and his bride, Willow, until they get a message from a desperate Morth: he convinces Whandall to return to Tep's Town and help eradicate, once and for all, an ancient magical being from Atlantis who has been trying to kill Morth for many years. The Burning City is a lively book that deftly integrates social concerns of today with the magic and mythology of yesterday.

"Niven, Larry","Larry Niven & Brenda Cooper","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  The first interstellar starship, *John Glenn,* fled a Solar System populated by rogue AIs and machine/human hybrids, threatened by too much nanotechnology and rife with political dangers. The *John Glenn’*s crew intended to terraform the nearly pristine planet Ymir, in hopes of creating a utopian society that will limit intelligent technology.   But by some miscalculation they have landed in another solar system, and extremely low on the antimatter needed to continue to Ymir, they must shape the nearby planet Harlequin’s moon, Selene, into a new, temporary home. Their only hope of ever reaching Ymir is to rebuild their store of antimatter through decades of terraforming the moon.   Gabriel, the head terraformer, must lead this nearly impossible task, with all the wrong materials. His primary tools are the uneducated and nearly illiterate children of the original colonists, born and bred to build Harlequin’s moon into a virtual antimatter factory. With no concept of the future and with life defined as duty, one girl, Rachel Vanowen, begins to ask herself the question: what will become of the children of Selene once the terraforming is complete.

Covert agent Sigmund Ausfaller is Earth's secret weapon, humanity's best defense against all conspiracies, real and potential - and imaginary - of foes both human and alien.  Who better than a brilliant paranoid to expose the devious plots of others?  He may finally have met his match in Nessus, representative of the secretive Puppeteers, the elder race who wield vastly superior technologies.  Nessus schemes in the shadows with Earth's traitors and adversaries, even after the race he represents abruptly vanishes from Known Space.  As a paranoid, Sigmund had always known things would end horribly for him.  Only the when, where, how, why, and by whom of it all had eluded him.  That fog has begun to lift...  But even Sigmund has never imagined how far his investigations will take him - or that his destiny is entwined with the fates of worlds.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Larry Niven, Edward M.

"Niven, Larry","Larry Niven & Jerry Pournelle","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Return to the ""vivid and unusual"" (*Kirkus Reviews*) world of Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's *The Burning City*, where the fire god has retreated into myth, leaving the residents of Tep's Town unprotected for the first time in their history.  Unfortunately, a fiery fate isn't the only danger the town is facing. From out of the desert come monsters -- great birds with blades instead of wings, driven by some unknown force. Although they can be killed, the threat these terror birds pose is worse than death. Danger on the roads means no trade. No trade means that Tep's Town will be no more.  Sent by the Lords of Lordshills to discover the source of the terror birds, Lord Sandry and his beloved, Burning Tower, must travel into a world where magic is still strong -- and wheresomeone or *something* waits to destroy them!  Filled with the sweeping adventure, memorable characters, and imaginative world-building that have defined the novels of Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, Burning Tower is another triumph.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Larry Niven\Burning Tower (2355)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:45:42+02:00","epub","9780743416924","2355","isbn:9780743416924","","Calibre Library","2010-02-16T02:00:00+02:00","Pocket","4","","1.0","443652","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Fantasy, Fantasy - General, Epic, Fiction - Fantasy, Fantasy - Epic, Niven; Larry - Prose & Criticism","Burning Tower","Burning Tower","88ebc7f5-754c-4b9d-ae4d-2fcc36dc087e"

"Niven, Larry","Larry Niven & Jerry Pournelle","SUMMARY: Monumental devastation will sweep across the globe if the newly-discovered Hamner-Brown comet collides with the one major obstacle in its path: Earth. For millionaire Tim Hamner, the comet is a ticket to immortality. For filmmaker Harvey Randall, it's a shot to redeem a flagging career. And for astronauts John Baker and Rick Delanty, it's a second chance for glory in outer space. But for a world gripped by comet fever, fascination quickly turns to fear. And only those who survive the impact will know the even greater terror, when rich and poor, politicians and killers, turn to each other or against each other--and the remnants of humanity grow savage to battle for what little remains . . .

"Niven, Larry","Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle","SUMMARY: In the year 3016, the Second Empire of Man spans hundreds of star systems, thanks to the faster-than-light Alderson Drive. No other intelligent beings have ever been encountered, not until a light sail probe enters a human system carrying a dead alien. The probe is traced to the Mote, an isolated star in a thick dust cloud, and an expedition is dispatched. In the Mote the humans find an ancient civilization--at least one million years old--that has always been bottled up in their cloistered solar system for lack of a star drive. The Moties are welcoming and kind, yet rather evasive about certain aspects of their society. It seems the Moties have a dark problem, one they've been unable to solve in over a million years. This is the first collaboration between Niven and Pournelle, two masters of hard science fiction, and it combines Pournelle's interest in the military and sociology with Niven's talent for creating interesting, believable aliens. The novel meticulously examines every aspect of First Contact, from the Moties' biology, society, and art, to the effects of the meeting on humanity's economics, politics, and religions. And all the while suspense builds as we watch the humans struggle toward the truth. --Brooks Peck","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle\The Mote in God's Eye (2361)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:45:43+02:00","epub","9780586217467","2361","isbn:9780586217467","","Calibre Library","1993-10-11T01:00:00+02:00","Collins","4","","1.0","536623","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction","The Mote in God's Eye","Mote in God's Eye, The","313702b0-77aa-4f2b-bb7e-6de7daff4495"

The Belt worlds had been tracking the Pak ship for days -- Brennan figured to meet that ship first...He was never seen again -- at least not by those alive at the time.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Larry Niven\Protector (2377)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:45:46+02:00","epub","9780345275103","2377","isbn:9780345275103","","Calibre Library","2010-02-15T21:30:00+02:00","Del Rey","4","","1.0","275849","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General","Protector","Protector","fa64fa1f-9c38-4c81-b556-36abf9b021d1"

"Niven, Larry","Larry Niven","SUMMARY: Larry Niven may be America's greatest living hard-SF writer. Much of his SF belongs to his famous future history, the Tales of Known Space. His preeminent creation is the Ringworld: an immense, artificial, ring-shaped planet that circles a Known Space star. Possibly SF's greatest feat of world-building, the Ringworld is featured in four novels: the Hugo and Nebula Award winner Ringworld (1970); The Ringworld Engineers (1980); The Ringworld Throne (1996); and Ringworld's Children (2004). Ringworld's Children returns series protagonist Louis Wu to the titular world. Louis and his friend The Hindmost, an alien of the Pierson's puppeteer race, are prisoners of the Ghoul protector Tunesmith, a Ringworld native, who is deliberately provoking the warships that surround his world. All the star-faring races of Known Space have sent warships to the Ringworld, and they are already at the brink of war. If fighting breaks out, the near-indestructible Ringworld will be destroyed: dissolved by antimatter weapons. The Ringworld series is so complex and ambitious that Ringworld's Children opens with a glossary and a cast of characters, inclusions that even many Known Space fans will need. Newcomers to Niven's artificial planet should start with Ringworld. --Cynthia Ward","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Larry Niven\Ringworld's Children (2381)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:45:47+02:00","epub","9780765341020","2381","isbn:9780765341020","","Calibre Library","2010-02-15T21:30:00+02:00","Tor Books","3","","1.0","315519","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - Adventure, Science Fiction - High Tech","Ringworld's Children","Ringworld's Children","013148cf-e9be-4939-bfb9-df578a605710"
"Niven, Larry","Larry Niven","SUMMARY: The kzin, formerly invincible conquerors of all they encountered, had a hard time dealing with their ignominious defeat by the leaf-eating humans. Some secretly hatched schemes for a rematch, others concentrated on gathering power within the kzin hierarchy, and some shamefully cooperated with the contemptible humans, though often for hidden motives. In war and in uneasy peace, kzin and humans continue their adventures, as told by Hal Colebatch, Paul Chafe, and Michael Joseph Harrington, expanding on the concepts created by New York Times best-selling writer Larry Niven.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Larry Niven\Man-Kzin Wars XII (2382)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:45:47+02:00","epub","9781439134108","2382","isbn:9781439134108","","Calibre Library","2010-03-18T02:00:00+02:00","Baen","4","Man-Kzin Wars","12.0","268104","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Short Stories, Science Fiction - Short Stories, Science Fiction - Military","Man-Kzin Wars XII","Man-Kzin Wars XII","77ff4f89-a82c-4170-8741-83256b872224"

Learning how to kill the beast is only the first step, for they must then reevaluate their entire understanding of Avalon's ecology.

Once he was outbound, where the Society that ruled Earth could not reach him, he headed his starship toward the galactic core, where the unimaginable energies of the Universe wrenched the fabric of time and space and promised final escape from his captors.Then he returned to an Earth eons older than the one he'd left...a planet that had had 3,000,000 years to develop perils he had never dreamed of -- perils that became nightmares that he had to escape...somehow!","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Larry Niven\A world out of time (2419)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:45:57+02:00","epub","9780345257505","2419","isbn:9780345257505","","Calibre Library","1976-03-15T02:00:00+02:00","New York : Ballantine Books, 1977, c1976.","4","","1.0","304598","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Space Opera, Adventure, Fantasy, Science fiction; American, Short Stories, Non-Classifiable, Nonfiction - General","A world out of time","world out of time, A","06abe794-d5e9-41a4-85bf-1b6bb4944a22"

"Nicholson, Scott","Scott Nicholson","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  For 13-year-old Ronnie Day, life is full of problems: Mom and Dad have separated, his brother Tim is a constant pest, Melanie Ward either loves him or hates him, and Jesus Christ won't stay in his heart. Plus he has to walk past the red church every day, where the Bell Monster hides with its wings and claws and livers for eyes. But the biggest problem is that Archer McFall is the new preacher at the church, and Mom wants Ronnie to attend midnight services with her. Sheriff Frank Littlefield hates the red church for a different reason. His little brother died in a freak accident at the church twenty years ago, and now Frank is starting to see his brother's ghost. And the ghost keeps demanding, ""Free me."" People are dying in Whispering Pines, and the murders coincide with McFall's return. The Days, the Littlefields, and the McFalls are descendants of the original families that settled the rural Appalachian community. Those old families share a secret of betrayal and guilt, and McFall wants his congregation to prove its faith. Because he believes he is the Second Son of God, and that the cleansing of sin must be done in blood. ""Sacrifice is the currency of God,"" McFall preaches, and unless Frank and Ronnie stop him, everybody pays.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Scott Nicholson\The red church (2429)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:02+02:00","epub","9780739425862","2429","isbn:9780739425862","","Calibre Library","2002-01-01T02:00:00+02:00","New York, NY : Kensington Pub.

"Nicholson, Scott","Scott Nicholson","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Ephram Korban was an admirer of the human creative spirit, dedicated to collecting art in its many forms--literature, photography, painting, and sculpture--before he took his own life. Nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains stands the home he built as a retreat for artists to hone their craft, perfect their skills...perhaps even produce a masterpiece. Isolated from the outside world in the electricity-free mansion, artists gather to court their muses for six weeks, undisturbed.        Anna Galloway has no interest in art and even less in the people who produce it. Her sensibilities are more in tune with the realm beyond the physical, where the souls of the deceased reside and visions reveal secrets. She has included herself among the elite artistes in residence at Korban's retreat because she has seen the manor in her dreams--and believes Korban's ghost may be wandering its halls.      Now, a blue moon is on the rise in October, opening magical pathways to conjure up something unimaginable. Something feeding off the energies of those in the house. Something seeking everlasting life--at any cost...","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Scott Nicholson\The Manor (2434)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:04+02:00","epub","9780786015801","2434","isbn:9780786015801","","Calibre Library","2004-09-01T01:00:00+02:00","Pinnacle Books","3","","1.0","248544","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Horror, Horror - General, Fiction - Horror","The Manor","Manor, The","01be0daf-2f29-4713-a005-e7cc12641241"

"Neal L. Asher","Neal Asher","SUMMARY: SCIENCE FICTION. From 800 years in the future, a runcible gate is opened into the Polity and those coming through it have been sent specially to take the alien 'Maker' back to its home civilization in the Small Magellanic cloud. Once these refugees are safely through, the gate itself is rapidly shut down - because something alien is pursuing them. The gate is then dumped into a nearby sun. From those refugees who get through, agent Cormac learns that the Maker civilization has been destroyed by pernicious virus known as the Jain technology. This, of course, raised questions: Why was Dragon, a massive biocontruct of the Makers, really sent to the Polity? And, Why did a Jain node suddenly end up in the hands of someone who could do the most damage with it? Meanwhile an entity called the Legate is distributing pernicious Jain nodes ...and a renegade attack ship, The King of Hearts, has encountered something very nasty outside the Polity itself.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Neal Asher\Polity agent (2446)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:06+02:00","epub","9780330441520","2446","isbn:9780330441520","","Calibre Library","2007-07-31T21:30:00+02:00","London : Tor, 2007, c2006.","4","","1.0","406914","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Adventure, Fantasy, Science Fiction - Adventure, Fantasy - General, Fiction & related items, Life on other planets","Polity agent","Polity agent","32ef5621-d92e-4aae-aff9-f4fdcc7e88d3"

"Neal L. Asher","Neal Asher","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  A massive science fiction drama from one of Britain's most popular new talents...      During a war between two planets in the same solar system - each occupied by adapted humans - what is thought to be a cosmic superstring is discovered. After being cut, this object collapses into four cylindrical pieces, each about the size of a tube train. Each is densely packed with either alien technology or some kind of life. They are placed for safety in three ozark cylinders of a massively secure space station. There a female research scientist subsequently falls pregnant, and gives birth to quads. Then she commits suicide - but why?         By the end of the war one of the contesting planets has been devastated by the hilldiggers - giant space dreadnoughts employing weapons capable of creating mountain ranges. The quads have meanwhile grown up and are assuming positions of power in the post-war society. One of them will eventually gain control of the awesome hilldiggers.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Neal Asher\Hilldiggers (2448)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:07+02:00","epub","9780330441537","2448","isbn:9780330441537","","Calibre Library","2008-04-10T21:30:00+02:00","London : Tor, 2008, c2007.","4","","1.0","383343","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Space Opera, Science Fiction - Space Opera, Fiction & related items, Space war","Hilldiggers","Hilldiggers","85274456-26f1-45f6-9ee8-feb28207c916"

"Morrow, James","James Morrow","SUMMARY: Job's back on the old dung heap, and he wants a rematch with God. A Series-700 computer successfully reconstructs the tablets with the Ten Commandments from a million indecipherable shards - only to have second thoughts. Sheila, the lascivious sinner fished from the Flood by the captain of the Ark, has an agenda all her own. A congregation of sexless androids believes Darwin's theory of evolution applies to them and awaits the Great Genital Coming. And God justifies why he once beset mankind with an unusual plague. Why? Spare the rod, spoil the species, He says. (And He's always right. That's why He's got the job.). James Morrow unabashedly delves into matters both sacred and secular in this collection of stories buoyed by his deliciously irreverent wit. Among the dozen offerings is ""Bible Stories for Adults, No. 17: The Deluge,"" winner of a Nebula Award for Best Short Story. Humorous, cheerfully blasphemous, and ultimately poignant, these tales show Morrow at his divine best.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\James Morrow\Bible stories for adults (2465)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:10+02:00","epub","9780156002448","2465","isbn:9780156002448","","Calibre Library","1996-01-30T21:30:00+02:00","New York : Harcourt Brace & Co., c1996.","4","","1.0","59930","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Space Opera, Adventure, Science fiction; American, Short Stories, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Satire; American","Bible stories for adults","Bible stories for adults","5de1340c-d3de-4163-9103-f3d7c32f1402"

"Morrison, John","John Morrison","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  When a Russian-speaking FBI counterintelligence agent decides to bug the Russian Embassy, he gets more than he bargained for. The Russians have stumbled onto a U.S. program for exploiting Thought Tunneling Devices (TTDs) found in alien tissue at a UFO crash site.       The technology has sweeping implications for both the U.S. information economy and for Russia, struggling to find its way in the New World Order. At stake is TTD technology, whose power is revealed in the death of a Russian diplomat--devoured by rats on a Washington, D.C. street--and related computer code able to penetrate any networked computer system, no matter how 'secure.'       When both spy and counter-spy are pursued by the same killers, they conspire to obtain the extraordinary evidence required to prove extraordinary claims--details of Project Ganymede that can only be found by penetrating a foreign technology test site at Groom Dry Lake Base, Nevada.       The technology that threatens to restart the Cold War ultimately proves elusive, when both Washington and the Russians learn that TTDs tap into a galactic Internet, and the owners of the patent don't like intruders...      The Ganymede Project is a gripping science-fiction technothriller, the movie rights to which have recently been optioned by The Woofenill Works, Inc.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\John Morrison\The Ganymede Project (2467)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:10+02:00","epub","9781931297424","2467","isbn:9781931297424","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","Bookbooters Press","","","1.0","279278","General, Fiction, Mystery & Detective","The Ganymede Project","Ganymede Project, The","8c86fb17-c19e-4e92-9516-6e7cef24d120"

Elle n'était pas jolie, mais Costals la désirait : 1° parce qu'il trouvait convenable que, dans la même minute où il caressait pour la première fois une jeune personne, il en désirât une autre; 2° parce que, donnant l'apparence du sommeil, il était impossible qu'elle ne levât pas en lui la pensée d'abuser de ce sommeil; 3° parce qu'il lui semblait que, pour éprouver une telle extase d'un phénomène aussi insipide que cette musique, il fallait qu'elle fût détraquée ; or, il n'aimait que les filles saines et simples, comme Solange, c'est pourquoi cela lui était agréable d'avoir envie d'une femme détraquée.

"Mitchell, Sandy","Sandy Mitchell","The new hardback Ciaphas Cain adventure
When the world of Quadravidia comes under attack by the insidious tau, only one man can defeat the aliens and save the planet in the Emperor’s name: the legendary Hero of the Imperium, Commissar Ciaphas Cain. When the aliens call for a ceasefire, Cain expects the worst, and his fears are answered in the form of the dread menace of the tyranids. As a hive fleet approaches Quadravidia, Cain must try to forge an alliance between the Imperium and the tau – but can he truly trust the inscrutable xenos?

"Mieville, China","China Mieville","SUMMARY: What is Un Lun Dun?It is London through the looking glass, an urban Wonderland of strange delights where all the lost and broken things of London end up . . . and some of its lost and broken people, too–including Brokkenbroll, boss of the broken umbrellas; Obaday Fing, a tailor whose head is an enormous pin-cushion, and an empty milk carton called Curdle. Un Lun Dun is a place where words are alive, a jungle lurks behind the door of an ordinary house, carnivorous giraffes stalk the streets, and a dark cloud dreams of burning the world. It is a city awaiting its hero, whose coming was prophesied long ago, set down for all time in the pages of a talking book.When twelve-year-old Zanna and her friend Deeba find a secret entrance leading out of London and into this strange city, it seems that the ancient prophecy is coming true at last. But then things begin to go shockingly wrong.From the Hardcover edition.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\China Mieville\Un Lun Dun (2502)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:19+02:00","epub","9780345458445","2502","isbn:9780345458445","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","Del Rey","4","","1.0","305790","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Adventure, Juvenile Fiction, Fantasy & Magic, Fantasy fiction, Children's Books - Young Adult Fiction, London (England), Children: Grades 4-6","Un Lun Dun","Un Lun Dun","6d6c31c2-a9c1-4a78-a4a8-b1c6fc238688"
"Mieville, China","China Mieville","SUMMARY: New York Times bestselling author China Miéville delivers his most accomplished novel yet, an existential thriller set in a city unlike any other–real or imagined.When a murdered woman is found in the city of Beszel, somewhere at the edge of Europe, it looks to be a routine case for Inspector Tyador Borlú of the Extreme Crime Squad. But as he investigates, the evidence points to conspiracies far stranger and more deadly than anything he could have imagined.Borlú must travel from the decaying Beszel to the only metropolis on Earth as strange as his own. This is a border crossing like no other, a journey as psychic as it is physical, a shift in perception, a seeing of the unseen. His destination is Beszel’s equal, rival, and intimate neighbor, the rich and vibrant city of Ul Qoma. With Ul Qoman detective Qussim Dhatt, and struggling with his own transition, Borlú is enmeshed in a sordid underworld of rabid nationalists intent on destroying their neighboring city, and unificationists who dream of dissolving the two into one. As the detectives uncover the dead woman’s secrets, they begin to suspect a truth that could cost them and those they care about more than their lives. What stands against them are murderous powers in Beszel and in Ul Qoma: and, most terrifying of all, that which lies between these two cities.Casting shades of Kafka and Philip K. Dick, Raymond Chandler and 1984, The City & the City is a murder mystery taken to dazzling metaphysical and artistic heights.From the Hardcover edition.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\China Mieville\The City & The City (2503)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:20+02:00","epub","9780345497529","2503","isbn:9780345497529","","Calibre Library","2010-04-27T01:00:00+02:00","Del Rey","4","","1.0","279784","General, Fiction, Fantasy, Fantasy - General, Fiction - Fantasy, Mystery & Detective, English Science Fiction And Fantasy","The City & The City","City & The City, The","2d89a14c-42eb-4a33-ae2b-486cf0dd0ad6"

"Meaney, John William","John Meaney","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  From John Meaney, the author of **Bone Song** and “the most important new SF writer of the 21st century,”* comes a new novel, **Black Blood**. In it he offers his intoxicating blend of futuristic noir and gothic fantasy in a thriller that carries a cop with a personal vendetta across the barrier between life and death. Here, in a morbidly lush necropolis, he must stop a conspiracy of killers whose power is fueled by spilling…****He’s lucky to be alive. That’s what everyone tells him. Except Tristopolitan police lieutenant Donal Riordan doesn’t feel lucky and he isn’t really alive. In one horrific moment not even death can erase from memory, Donal lost the woman he loved even as her ultimate sacrifice saved his life. Now it’s literally her heart that beats in his chest and her murder that Donal “lives” to avenge.While being a zombie cop has its upsides—including inhuman reaction time and razor-sharp senses—Donal’s new undead status makes him the target of Tristopolis’s powerful Unity Party, whose startling rise to power is built on a platform of antizombie paranoia and persecution. The Party is no friend, to be sure—but it’s the secret cabal known as the Black Circle and their stranglehold on the city’s elite that consume Donal’s black heart. For at the center of this ring of evil is the man responsible for his lover’s murder—a man Donal has already had to kill once before.Now, with ominous reports of white wolf sightings throughout the city and a dangerous sabotage attempt at police headquarters, all signs indicate that the Black Circle is planning a magical coup d’état. And the terror will begin with a political assassination triggered by a necroninja already hidden… in a place no one expects. For Donal, it’s no longer a matter of life and death but something far more serious.

Here, in a city of the dead where desire is very much alive and murder a pleasure for connoisseurs, an honest cop must face his own darkest impulses just to have a prayer.There have been four victims already. Famed for their beauty and one-of-a-kind artistic gifts, they were murdered in the most shocking ways imaginable and their corpses stolen. Now the famed diva Maria daLivnova is arriving in Tristopolis—a city literally powered by the massive necroflux generators that process the dead—and it is up to Lieutenant Donal Riordan to make sure she ends her limited engagement alive.But Riordan isn’t the only one watching deLivnova. For the Diva is being followed by two other secret “protectors”: Commander Laura Steele—who’s made a more or less successful transition to para-life—and her partner, the invisible free-wraith Xalia. They are part of the necropolis’s vast underground network and they’ve mobilized against an unseen enemy for a battle of epic proportions. For a perverse death cult with powerful members in every stratum of society has learned how to distill from the bones of their sacrificed victims the ultimate thrill—a nectar that, once tasted, is impossible to resist. And the more precious the life, the greater the pleasure it is to take it away.Soon Riordan will find himself in the unlikeliest of alliances as he journeys through a world of corruption—both aboveground and below—among gargoyles and zombies, spirit slaves and assassins, science and sorcery, in search of an enemy even the dead have every reason to fear….","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\John Meaney\Bone Song (2519)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:23+02:00","epub","9780553385144","2519","isbn:9780553385144","","Calibre Library","2008-02-26T02:00:00+02:00","Spectra","4","","1.0","305929","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fantasy, Fantasy - General, Epic, Fantasy fiction, Fiction - Fantasy, Horror, Suspense, Thrillers, Mystery & Detective, Suspense fiction, Fantasy - Dark, Assassins, Noir fiction, Conspiracies, Serial murders, Zombies","Bone Song","Bone Song","ef454b39-2b49-45ff-854b-a8d41feba8e7"

"McMullen, Sean","Sean McMullen","SUMMARY: Sean McMullen, frequent winner of Australia's top science fiction award, the Ditmar, has created a fascinating adventure through time in The Centurion's Empire. From A.D. 71 to 2029, the Roman centurion Vitellan hibernates through the centuries via an elixir made from snow-dwelling insects. Unfortunately, he doesn't possess the antidote for the corrosive substance, so every time he is awakened, his body is more ravaged. His frigidarium is secreted beneath an English village, and as the Danes invade during the Dark Ages, the villagers, in fear for their lives, awaken him. He teaches them Roman martial discipline and they fight off the Danish rabble, but he's so weak that he must return to his cold sleep and await better medicine in the future. He is awakened in 1358 to battle again, this time in France, but it's his next awakening--in 2028--that propels the latter half of the novel into a thrill ride of nanotech-embellished skullduggery, as Illuminati-like factions vie for control of the resurrected hero. The centurion's viewpoint offers both a window into history and a ledge to stand on while peering into the future. Readers who enjoy the juxtaposition of historical novel with science-fiction adventure, as in Ian McDonald's King of Morning, Queen of Day, will appreciate McMullen's expertise in The Centurion's Empire. --Blaise Selby","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Sean McMullen\The Centurion's Empire (2524)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:26+02:00","epub","9780812564754","2524","isbn:9780812564754","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","Tor Science Fiction","4","","1.0","358234","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, High Tech, Science Fiction - High Tech","The Centurion's Empire","Centurion's Empire, The","cea50598-ec17-4f81-8fe7-833a9d2d4e09"

When it opened, however, he knew that it was much, much worse. His world was being invaded by pitiless sorcerers from Lupan, who could sweep whole armies aside, and even defeat the invulnerable glass dragons. Surrender or flight were the only options ... but not for Inspector Danolarian, his Wayfarer Constables, and his sweetheart, the sorceress Lavenci.Although Danolarian is no sorcerer, he's no ordinary Wayfarer either. Faced with civilization crumbling around him, and organized resistance shattered by the invincible magic of the Lupanians, he chances upon an unlikely ally and begins to fight back. It won't be easy, for he has to rally the demoralized sorcerers of Alberin, organize its terrified citizens, stay one step ahead of his own past, and, most importantly, survive a dinner party with Lavenci's mother.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Sean McMullen\Voidfarer (2525)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:26+02:00","epub","9780765352927","2525","isbn:9780765352927","","Calibre Library","2007-04-03T01:00:00+02:00","New York : Tor, c2007.","","","1.0","349266","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fantasy, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Epic, Fantasy fiction, Fiction - Fantasy, Fantasy - Epic, Imaginary wars and battles, Humorous","Voidfarer","Voidfarer","c2e1eb4d-a608-458f-b876-2fdf0994f069"

"McHugh, Maureen F.","Maureen F. McHugh","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Maureen F. McHugh is the author of four acclaimed novels. Her genre-expanding short fiction has won the Hugo and Locus Awards and has frequently been included in Best of the Year anthologies.       Now, in her luminous, long-awaited debut collection, McHugh wryly and delicately examines the impacts of social and technological shifts on families. Using beautiful, deceptively simple prose, she illuminates the relationship between parents and children and the expected and unexpected chasms that open between generations.       - A woman introduces her new lover to her late brother.       - A teenager is interviewed about her peer group's attitudes toward sex and baby boomers.      - A missing stepson sets a marriage on edge.       - Anthropologists visiting an isolated outpost mission are threatened by nomadic raiders.       McHugh's characters -- her Alzheimers-afflicted parents or her smart and rebellious teenagers -- are always recognizable: stubborn, human, and heartbreakingly real and are brought to life with graceful restraint and delicacy.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Maureen F.

Enlisted and officer. It’s unnatural.      Terry and Jodenny have been assigned to duty on the planet Fortune, away from the huge ships that carry colonists from the wreckage of polluted Earth to clean new worlds across the galaxy.      But there’s another way besides spaceships to travel from world to world. A group within Team Space is exploring the Wondjina Spheres, a set of ancient alien artifacts that link places and times. Now those spheres have shut down and Team Space thinks that Terry and Jodenny are part of the key to make them work again —no matter how the two of them feel about it. They can volunteer, or be “volunteered.”      What the researchers can’t anticipate is that the status quo, in which Team Space holds the monopoly on travel between worlds, is about to change. And as a result, Terry and Jodenny will be tested to their limits and beyond….","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Sandra McDonald\The stars down under (2534)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:28+02:00","epub","9780765316448","2534","isbn:9780765316448","","Calibre Library","2008-03-18T02:00:00+02:00","New York : Tor, 2008.","4","","1.0","273649","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, High Tech, Space Opera, Adventure, Fantasy, Science Fiction - Adventure, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Epic, Science Fiction - Military","The stars down under","stars down under, The","c67771bb-a51a-458f-a280-693bd301bac6"
"McDonald, Sandra","Sandra McDonald","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Lieutenant Jodenny Scott is a hero.  She has the medals and the scars to prove it.     She's cooling her heels on Kookaburra, recovering from injuries sustained during the fiery loss of her last ship, the *Yangtze,* and she's bored -- so bored, in fact, that she takes a berth on the next ship out.  That's a mistake.  The *Aral Sea** *isn't anyone's idea of a get-well tour.     Jodenny's handed a division full of misfits, incompetents, and criminals.  She's a squared-away officer.  She thinks she can handle it all.  She's wrong.   *Aral Sea** *isn't a happy ship.  And it's about to get a lot unhappier.     As *Aral Sea* enters the Alcheringa -- the alien-constructed space warp that allows giant settler-ships to travel between worlds, away from all help or hope -- Jodenny comes face to face something powerful enough to dwarf even the unknown force that destroyed her last ship and left her with missing memories and bloody nightmares.  Lieutenant Jodenny Scott is about to be introduced to love.     Author Sandra McDonald brings her personal knowledge of the military, and of the subtle interplay between men and women on deployment, to a stirring tale that mixes ancient Australian folklore with the colonization of the stars.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Sandra McDonald\The Outback Stars (2535)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:28+02:00","epub","9780765316431","2535","isbn:9780765316431","","Calibre Library","2007-04-16T21:30:00+02:00","Tor Books","4","","1.0","338783","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, High Tech, Space Opera, Adventure, Fantasy, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Science Fiction - Military","The Outback Stars","Outback Stars, The","2fbf9f64-a4b7-438a-82bc-111c5bce79bc"

"McDonald, Ian R.","Ian McDonald","SUMMARY: Think Bladerunner in the tropics... Be seduced, amazed, and shocked by one of the world's greatest and strangest nations. Past, present, and future Brazil, with all its color, passion, and shifting realities, come together in a novel that is part SF, part history, part mystery, and entirely enthralling. Three separate stories follow three main characters: Edson is a self-made talent impressario one step up from the slums in a near future São Paulo of astonishing riches and poverty. A chance encounter draws Edson into the dangerous world of illegal quantum computing, but where can you run in a total surveillance society where every move, face, and centavo is constantly tracked? Marcelina is an ambitious Rio TV producer looking for that big reality TV hit to make her name. When her hot idea leads her on the track of a disgraced World Cup soccer goalkeeper, she becomes enmeshed in an ancient conspiracy that threatens not just her life, but her very soul. Father Luis is a Jesuit missionary sent into the maelstrom of 18th-century Brazil to locate and punish a rogue priest who has strayed beyond the articles of his faith and set up a vast empire in the hinterland. In the company of a French geographer and spy, what he finds in the backwaters of the Amazon tries both his faith and the nature of reality itself to the breaking point. Three characters, three stories, three Brazils, all linked together across time, space, and reality in a hugely ambitious story that will challenge the way you think about everything.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Ian McDonald\Brasyl (2541)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:29+02:00","epub","9780575080515","2541","isbn:9780575080515","","Calibre Library","2007-03-15T02:00:00+02:00","Gollancz","3","","1.0","209256","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Space Opera, Adventure, Fantasy, Brazil","Brasyl","Brasyl","a698e80c-0ead-47d0-81a3-e9d99f17e2a7"

It is difficult growing up in the shadow of heroes revered throughout the galaxy. But that is the lot of young Khorii -- daughter of the legendary Acorna and her lifemate Aari -- who must now follow her own destiny through a fantastic universe of wonders and perils.   On a journey, Khorii's trip is delayed when her ship encounters a derelict spacecraft floating aimlessly among the stars, its crew dead in their seats. Suddenly a planned visit by her parents has turned into a terrifying race against time as a deadly plague spreads relentlessly across the universe. Even the healing powers of the Linyaari cannot slow its horrific advance. And now Khorii, one of the few unaffected by the outbreak, must find an antidote -- before the scourge consumes everyone and everything in its path . . . including those she loves above all others.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Anne McCaffrey\First Warning_ Acorna's Children (2556)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:33+02:00","epub","9780060525392","2556","isbn:9780060525392","","Calibre Library","2006-06-08T01:00:00+02:00","Eos","3","","1.0","293456","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Fantasy, Life on other planets, Science Fiction - Series, Young women, Space ships, Mothers and daughters, Plague, Unicorns, Mccaffrey; Anne - Prose & Criticism, Acorna (Fictitious character)","First Warning: Acorna's Children","First Warning: Acorna's Children","6399165d-e61f-4a2f-97d3-0f2f140952f7"

"McAuley, Paul J.","Paul J. McAuley","SUMMARY: Twenty-third century Earth, ravaged by climate change, looks backwards to the holy ideal of a pre-industrial Eden. Political power has been grabbed by a few powerful families and their green saints. Millions of people are imprisoned in teeming cities; millions more labour on Pharaonic projects to rebuild ruined ecosystems. On the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, the Outers, descendants of refugees from Earth's repressive regimes, have constructed a wild variety of self-sufficient cities and settlements: scientific utopias crammed with exuberant creations of the genetic arts; the last outposts of every kind of democratic tradition. The fragile detente between the Outer cities and the dynasties of Earth is threatened by the ambitions of the rising generation of Outers, who want to break free of their cosy, inward-looking pocket paradises, colonise the rest of the Solar System, and drive human evolution in a hundred new directions. On Earth, many demand pre-emptive action against the Outers before it's too late; others want to exploit the talents of their scientists and gene wizards.Amid campaigns for peace and reconciliation, political machinations, crude displays of military might, and espionage by cunningly wrought agents, the two branches of humanity edge towards war . ..","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Paul J.

"MARK BUDZ","Mark Budz","SUMMARY: In such groundbreaking novels as Crache and Idolon, Mark Budz established his reputation as one of science fiction’s most exciting and innovative writers. Now he surprises us again with an ambitious new thriller set in three realities at once, where three different lives hang in the balance….What if your world were rapidly running out of tomorrows? And what if the only way to save the future was to relive the past? But which past holds the key to survival? That’s the life-and-death question faced by three desperate people separated by the past, present, and future but who share a single terrifying reality. A tortured soul, brain-damaged in a motorcycle accident, issues a pirate broadcast out of a van in near-future California. In Depression-era San Francisco an architect with an inoperable brain tumor seeks a mystical cure. A post-human space traveler caught in a cosmic accident searches for a way to reconstruct himself and the future. In Mark Budz’s spellbinding narrative, their lives–and deaths–are drawn together by a force even more powerful than destiny.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Mark Budz\Till Human Voices Wake Us (2586)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:42+02:00","epub","9780553588514","2586","isbn:9780553588514","","Calibre Library","2007-07-30T21:30:00+02:00","Spectra","","","1.0","326069","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, High Tech, Space Opera, Adventure, Space and time, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Science Fiction - High Tech, Space travelers, Architects, Motorcycling accidents, Individual Architect, Architecture","Till Human Voices Wake Us","Till Human Voices Wake Us","0bfb5dbb-f9e8-4a6c-8bfb-79b328200d51"

This is an OCR edition with typos.  Excerpt from book:  Ill    THE old man wiped the tears away on his grimy knuckles and took up the tale in a tremulous, piping voice that soon strengthened as he got the swing of the narrative.    ""It was in the summer of 2013 that the Plague came. I was twenty-seven years old, and well do I remember it. Wireless despatches —""    Hare-Lip spat loudly his disgust, and Granser hastened to make amends.    ""We talked through the air in those days, thousands and thousands of miles. And the word came of a strange disease that had broken out in New York. There were seventeen millions of people living then in that noblest city of America. Nobody thought anything about the news. It was only a small thing. There had been only a few deaths. It seemed, though, that they had died very quickly, and that one of the first signs of the disease was the turning red of the face and all the body. Within twenty-four hours came the report of the first case in Chicago. And on the same day, it was made public that London, the greatest city in the world, next to Chicago, had been secretly fighting the plague for two weeks and censoring the news despatches — that is, not permitting the word to go forth to the rest of the world that London had the plague.    ""It looked serious, but we in California, like everywhere else, were not alarmed. We were sure that the bacteriologists would find a way to overcome this new germ, just asthey had overcome other germs in the past. But the trouble was the astonishing quickness with which this germ destroyed human beings, and the fact that it inevitably killed any human body it entered. No one ever recovered. There was the old Asiatic cholera, when you might eat dinner with a well man in the evening, and the next morning, if you got up early enough, you would see him being hauled by your windo...","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Jack London\The Scarlet Plague (2644)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:54+02:00","epub","9780554651521","2644","isbn:9780554651521","","Calibre Library","2010-06-13T01:00:00+02:00","BiblioLife","4","","1.0","1149813","General, History, History - General History, History: World & General","The Scarlet Plague","Scarlet Plague, The","721c20f8-0e9b-4345-8364-889b2ef9309b"

"Lewis, Michael","Michael Lewis","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  The #1 New York Times bestseller: a brilliant account—character-rich and darkly humorous—of how the U.S. economy was driven over the cliff.  When the crash of the U. S. stock market became public knowledge in the fall of 2008, it was already old news. The real crash, the silent crash, had taken place over the previous year, in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn’t shine, and the SEC doesn’t dare, or bother, to tread: the bond and real estate derivative markets where geeks invent impenetrable securities to profit from the misery of lower- and middle-class Americans who can’t pay their debts. The smart people who understood what was or might be happening were paralyzed by hope and fear; in any case, they weren’t talking.    The crucial question is this: Who understood the risk inherent in the assumption of ever-rising real estate prices, a risk compounded daily by the creation of those arcane, artificial securities loosely based on piles of doubtful mortgages?  Michael Lewis turns the inquiry on its head to create a fresh, character-driven narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor, a fitting sequel to his #1 best-selling Liar’s Poker. Who got it right? he asks. Who saw the real estate market for the black hole it would become, and eventually made billions of dollars from that perception? And what qualities of character made those few persist when their peers and colleagues dismissed them as Chicken Littles? Out of this handful of unlikely—really unlikely—heroes, Lewis fashions a story as compelling and unusual as any of his earlier bestsellers, proving yet again that he is the finest and funniest chronicler of our times.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Michael Lewis\The Big Short_ Inside the Doomsday (2659)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:46:58+02:00","epub","9780393072235","2659","isbn:9780393072235","","Calibre Library","2009-11-02T07:00:00+02:00","W.

"Lalonde, Randolph","Randolph Lalonde","SUMMARY: Large enough to support an entire civilization, one of the last free ports all alone in the dark, Freeground Station is about to come under siege. Able to fight off periodical assaults and attempted takeovers in the past, they are losing ground technologically, and with no nearby allies they find themselves resorting to the unorthodox to improve their situation. Jonas Valent, a former engineer with the Freeground Fleet has reduced his professional life as a trade and supply agent, a not so glorified port traffic director. In his spare time he and his friends engage in anonymous combat with anyone who opposes them in station wide simulations. Their success rate and original thinking have earned them the attention of Freeground Fleet Command who have plans for the unsuspecting anonymous team. This book is about how it all began for Jonas and his friends.

Now he's caught in a battle between an elven King and his skateboard-riding champion and a mad Prince of the Dark Elves and his demon drug-pusher. Also caught in the middle are two mortal bikers: Wolf, an ex-vet who's a mage-in-training. It's up to Thorn to save the two without getting the tattered remnant of his spirit blasted to the four winds . . .","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Mark Shepherd\Spiritride (2799)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:47:47+02:00","epub","9780671877750","2799","isbn:9780671877750","","Calibre Library","1997-04-01T01:00:00+02:00","Baen","","","1.0","275242","General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fantasy, Fantasy - General, Non-Classifiable, Fiction - Fantasy, Motorcyclists","Spiritride","Spiritride","6764bf09-d98f-4fc6-97d7-48f5e2ecf4bd"

"Kurzweil, Ray","Ray Kurzweil","### From Publishers Weekly
 *Starred Review.* Renowned inventor Kurzweil (_The Age of Spiritual Machines_) may be technology's most credibly hyperbolic optimist. Elsewhere he has argued that eliminating fat intake can prevent cancer; here, his quarry is the future of consciousness and intelligence. Humankind, it runs, is at the threshold of an epoch (""the singularity,"" a reference to the theoretical limitlessness of exponential expansion) that will see the merging of our biology with the staggering achievements of ""GNR"" (genetics, nanotechnology and robotics) to create a species of unrecognizably high intelligence, durability, comprehension, memory and so on. The word ""unrecognizable"" is not chosen lightly: wherever this is heading, it won't look like us. Kurzweil's argument is necessarily twofold: it's not enough to argue that there are virtually no constraints on our capacity; he must also convince readers that such developments are desirable. In essence, he conflates the wholesale transformation of the species with ""immortality,"" for which read a repeal of human limit. In less capable hands, this phantasmagoria of speculative extrapolation, which incorporates a bewildering variety of charts, quotations, playful Socratic dialogues and sidebars, would be easier to dismiss. But Kurzweil is a true scientist—a large-minded one at that—and gives due space both to ""the panoply of existential risks"" as he sees them and the many presumed lines of attack others might bring to bear. What's arresting isn't the degree to which Kurzweil's heady and bracing vision fails to convince—given the scope of his projections, that's inevitable—but the degree to which it seems downright plausible. *(Sept.)*

### From
Kurzweil is one of the world’s most respected thinkers and entrepreneurs. Yet the thesis he posits in *Singularity* is so singular that many readers will be astounded—and perhaps skeptical. Think *Blade Runner* or *Being John Malkovich* magnified trillion-fold. Even if one were to embrace his techno-optimism, which he backs up with fascinating details, Kurzweil leaves some important questions relating to politics, economics, and morality unanswered. If machines in our bodies can rebuild cells, for example, why couldn’t they be reengineered as weapons? Or think of singularity, notes the *New York Times Book Review* , as the ""Manhattan Project model of pure science without ethical constraints."" Kurzweil’s vision requires technology, which we continue to build. But it also requires mass acceptance and faith.

 **A thrilling new adventure of danger and deep-sea diving, historic mystery and suspense, by the author of the *New York Times* bestseller *Shadow Divers ** *  
******  
Finding and identifying a pirate ship is the hardest thing to do under the sea. But two men—John Chatterton and John Mattera—are willing to risk everything to find the* Golden Fleece, *the ship of the infamous pirate Joseph Bannister. At large during the Golden Age of Piracy in the seventeenth century, Bannister should have been immortalized in the lore of the sea—his exploits more notorious than Blackbeard’s, more daring than Kidd’s. But his story, and his ship, have been lost to time. If Chatterton and Mattera succeed, they will make history—it will be just the second time ever that a pirate ship has been discovered and positively identified. Soon, however, they realize that cutting-edge technology and a willingness to lose everything aren’t enough to track down Bannister’s ship. They must travel the globe in search of historic documents and accounts of the great pirate’s exploits, face down dangerous rivals, battle the tides of nations and governments and experts. But it’s only when they learn to think and act like pirates—like Bannister—that they become able to go where no pirate hunters have gone before.  
  
Fast-paced and filled with suspense, fascinating characters, history, and adventure, *Pirate Hunters* is an unputdownable story that goes deep to discover truths and souls long believed lost. 
**Advance praise for *Pirate Hunters** *  
 ****  
“A great thriller full of tough guys and long odds . . . and: It’s all true.” **—Lee Child**  
  
“Action and adventure on land and sea—you can’t ask for more. But Robert Kurson raises the ante in *Pirate Hunters *with an array of mystery and a fleet of colorful characters spanning four centuries. This is a great summer read!” **—Michael Connelly**  
  
“*Pirate Hunters *is a fantastic book, an utterly engrossing and satisfying read. It tells the story of the hunt for the rare wreck of a pirate ship, which had been captained by one of the most remarkable pirates in history. This is a real-life* Treasure Island, *complete with swashbuckling, half-crazy treasure hunters and vivid Caribbean settings—a story for the ages.” **—Douglas Preston**  
  
“A terrific read. I was pulled in from page one. Kurson brings us face to face with some of the most swashbuckling pirates ever to sail the Caribbean, even as he takes us underwater on a high-tech quest to discover the relics they left behind.” **—Daniel James Brown**  
  
“There’s nothing in the world like buried treasure—and people hungry and obsessed enough to risk their lives for it. *Pirate Hunters *isn’t just a good story—it’s a true one. Searching for the souls of its explorers, it takes you to the far tip of the plank and plunges you deep to the bottom of the ocean.” **—Brad Meltzer**  
  
“*Pirate Hunters* is a gripping account of two courageous divers’ quest to uncover the shipwrecked vessel of Joseph Bannister, one of history’s most infamous pirates. Robert Kurson will keep you on the edge of your seat in this high-stakes journey around the globe that ultimately teaches these explorers about much more than an old ship.” **—Sen. John McCain**  
  
“Kurson’s own enthusiasm, combined with his copious research and an eye for detail, makes for one of the most mind-blowing pirate stories of recent memory.” **— *Publishers Weekly* (starred review)**
*From the Hardcover edition.*

Deep in the Pacific Ocean, the spacecraft has been waiting two centuries for this moment, when humanity finally awakens to a greater destiny. The Confederation has other ideas. It possesses Strela, a new class of missile, thanks to the jewels, that can bring the spacecraft's secrets home to Russia. A new World War-and World Order-is imminent.

"Diamandis, Peter H. & Kotler, Steven","Peter H. Diamandis & Steven Kotler","**Providing abundance is humanity’s grandest challenge—this is a book about how we rise to meet it.**
We will soon be able to meet and exceed the basic needs of every man, woman and child on the planet. Abundance for all is within our grasp. This bold, contrarian view, backed up by exhaustive research, introduces our near-term future, where exponentially growing technologies and three other powerful forces are conspiring to better the lives of billions. An antidote to pessimism by tech entrepreneur turned philanthropist, Peter H. Diamandis and award-winning science writer Steven Kotler. 
Since the dawn of humanity, a privileged few have lived in stark contrast to the hardscrabble majority. Conventional wisdom says this gap cannot be closed. But it is closing—fast. The authors document how four forces—exponential technologies, the DIY innovator, the Technophilanthropist, and the Rising Billion—are conspiring to solve our biggest problems. Abundance establishes hard targets for change and lays out a strategic roadmap for governments, industry and entrepreneurs, giving us plenty of reason for optimism.
Examining human need by category—water, food, energy, healthcare, education, freedom—Diamandis and Kotler introduce dozens of innovators making great strides in each area: Larry Page, Steven Hawking, Dean Kamen, Daniel Kahneman, Elon Musk, Bill Joy, Stewart Brand, Jeff Skoll, Ray Kurzweil, Ratan Tata, Craig Venter, among many, many others. 
### Review
“At a moment when our world faces multiple crises and is awash in pessimism, *Abundance* redirects the conversation, spotlighting scientific innovators working to improve people's lives around the world. The result is more than a portrait of brilliant minds - it's a reminder of the infinite possibilities for doing good when we tap into our own empathy and wisdom.”— **Arianna Huffington, CEO, Huffington Post**  

“This brilliant must-read book provides the key to the coming era of abundance replacing eons of scarcity, a powerful antidote to today’s malaise and pessimism.”— **Ray Kurzweil, inventor, author and futurist, author of *The Singularity is Near** *  

""Now that human beings communicate so easily, I suspect that nothing can stop the inevitable torrent of new technologies, new ideas and new arrangements that will transform the lives of our children. Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler give us a blinding glimpse of the innovations that are coming our way — and that they are helping to create. This is a vital book.""— **Matt Ridley, author of *The Rational Optimist** *  

“Comprehensively sampled here are a hell of a lot of the profound innovations going on to improve the human condition. Every breakthrough helps empower others, and so they aggregate into a trend you can count on.”— **Stewart Brand, author,* Whole Earth Discipline** *  

“Diamandis and Kotler challenge us all to solve humanity’s grand challenges. Innovative small teams are now empowered to accomplish what only governments and large corporations could once achieve. The result is nothing less than the most transformative and thrilling period in human history.” **––Timothy Ferriss, #1 NY Times bestselling author of The 4-Hour Workweek**  

“Today, philanthropists, innovators and passionate entrepreneurs are more empowered than ever before to solve humanity’s grand challenges. *Abundance* chronicles many of these stories and the emerging tools driving us towards an age of abundance. This is an audacious and powerful read!”— **Jeff Skoll**  

“Diamandis and Kotler do a masterful job of explaining why we are at the start of a new era of radically increasing standards of living throughout the world. *Abundance* is essential reading for anyone looking for a better tomorrow.”— **Elon Musk, CEO, SpaceX, CEO, Tesla Motors, Founder, PayPal**  

“ *Abundance* provides proof that the proper combination of technology, people and capital can meet any grand challenge.”— **Sir Richard Branson, Chairman of the Virgin Group**  

""This engaging book is a needed corrective, a whirlwind tour of the latest developments in health care, agriculture, energy, and other fields ...The authors make a compelling case for optimism over dread as we face the exhilarating unknown. "" -- ** *Publisher's Weekly***  

""If the future isn’t necessarily bright enough for shades, then, write high-tech pioneer Diamandis and science journalist Kotler think things are going to work out just fine...A nicely optimistic look at a matter that usually brings out the darkest thoughts among prognosticators..."" -- ** *Kirkus***

"Koman, Victor","Victor Koman","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Dr. Evelyn Fletcher is a surgeon caught in a maelstrom of   controversy. She has secretly devised a surgical procedure that could   alter the lives of millions. When the beautiful and successful Valerie   Dalton walks into Fletcher's office for a routine abortion, the doctor   realizes that she has found the perfect experimental subject.      In another room of the same clinic wait Karen Chandler and her husband,   who have sought pregnancy for years with no success. They greet   Fletcher's offer of a radically new embryo-implant procedure as a   miracle. Karen, with no hesitation, agrees to undergo the questionable   surgery.      When little Renata is born and then falls deathly ill, only one person can save her life. A woman who does not even know her   daughter exists. Under a barrage of media scrutiny, Valerie Dalton must   face the courts with her lover in an unprecedented custody battle.   Ultimately, she plumbs the depths of her shattered soul to find an   answer to the conflict that rages within her and all   society.      *Solomon's Knife* is a masterful and fiery mixture   of medical thriller and courtroom drama that fuses every facet of the   most violently debated issue of our age. The reality it foreshadows is   only years -- perhaps months -- away.        **Prometheus Award   Winner!**","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Victor Koman\Solomon's Knife (2916)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:10+02:00","epub","9781584450726","2916","isbn:9781584450726","","Calibre Library","1989-12-15T02:00:00+02:00","Pulpless.com, Incorporated","","","1.0","260234","Fiction, Medical, Psychological, Fiction - Psychological Suspense","Solomon's Knife","Solomon's Knife","f4c1278b-0293-42a9-9b75-34a12fa1a746"

From the Book of Revelations to The Road Warrior; from A Canticle for Leibowitz to The Road, storytellers have long imagined the end of the world, weaving tales of catastrophe, chaos, and calamity. Gathering together the best post-apocalyptic literature of the last two decades from many of today's most renowned authors of speculative fiction, including George R.R. Martin, Gene Wolfe, Orson Scott Card, Carol Emshwiller, Jonathan Lethem, Octavia E. Butler, and Stephen King, Wastelands explores the scientific, psychological, and philosophical questions of what it means to remain human in the wake of Armageddon.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\edited by John Joseph Adams\Wastelands_ stories of the Apocalyp (2936)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:14+02:00","epub","9781597801058","2936","isbn:9781597801058","","Calibre Library","2008-01-15T02:00:00+02:00","San Francisco : Night Shade Books, c2008.","4","","1.0","379677","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science fiction; American, Anthologies, Short Stories, Comics & Graphic Novels, Science fiction; Australian, Science Fiction - Short Stories, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Short stories; American, End of the world, Graphic Novels: General, Graphic novels, Short Story, Short stories; Australian, Armageddon","Wastelands: stories of the Apocalypse","Wastelands: stories of the Apocalypse","18de4cc8-3ce3-4f92-9eeb-4555db5d5561"
"King, Stephen Harris Morley","Stephen King","SUMMARY: In the introduction to Skeleton Crew (1985), his second collection of stories, King pokes fun at his penchant for ""literary elephantiasis,"" makes scatological jokes about his muse, confesses how much money he makes (gross and net), and tells a story about getting arrested one time when he was ""suffused with the sort of towering, righteous rage that only drunk undergraduates can feel."" He winds up with an invitation to a scary voyage: ""Grab onto my arm now. Hold tight. We are going into a number of dark places, but I think I know the way."" And he sure does. Skeleton Crew contains a superb short novel (""The Mist"") that alone is worth the price of admission, plus two forgettable poems and 20 short stories on such themes as an evil toy monkey, a human-eating water slick, a machine that avenges murder, and unnatural creatures that inhabit the thick woods near Castle Rock, Maine. The short tales range from simply enjoyable to surprisingly good. In addition to ""The Mist,"" the real standout is ""The Reach,"" a beautifully subtle story about a great-grandmother who was born on a small island off the coast of Maine and has lived there her whole life. She has never been across ""the Reach,"" the body of water between island and mainland.

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: Stephen King The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah with 10 full-color illustrations by Darrel Anderson The next-to-last novel in Stephen King's seven-volume magnum opus, Song of Susannah is at once a book of revelation, a fascinating key to the unfolding mystery of the Dark Tower, and a fast-paced story of double-barreled suspense. To give birth to her ""chap,"" demon-mother Mia has usurped the body of Susannah Dean and used the power of Black Thirteen to transport to New York City in the summer of 1999. The city is strange to Susannah...and terrifying to the ""daughter of none,"" who shares her body and mind. Saving the Tower depends not only on rescuing Susannah but also on securing the vacant lot Calvin Tower owns before he loses it to the Sombra Corporation. Enlisting the aid of Manni senders, the remaining katet climbs to the Doorway Cave...and discovers that magic has its own mind. It falls to the boy, the billy-bumbler, and the fallen priest to find Susannah-Mia, who, in a struggle to cope -- with each other and with an alien environment -- ""go todash"" to Castle Discordia on the border of End-World. In that forsaken place, Mia reveals her origins, her purpose, and her fierce desire to mother whatever creature the two of them have carried to term. Eddie and Roland, meanwhile, tumble into western Maine in the summer of 1977, a world that should be idyllic but isn't. For one thing, it is real, and the bullets are flying. For another, it is inhabited by the author of a novel called 'Salem's Lot, a writer who turns out to be as shocked by them as they are by him. These are the simple vectors of a story rich in complexity and conflict. Its dual climaxes, one at the entrance to a deadly dining establishment and the other appended to the pages of a writer's journal, will leave readers gasping for the saga's final volume (which, Dear Reader, follows soon, say thank ya).","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\Song of Susannah (The Dark Tower, B (2960)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:19+02:00","epub","9781880418598","2960","isbn:9781880418598","","Calibre Library","2004-06-08T01:00:00+02:00","Donald M.

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: In the fall of 1978 (between The Stand and The Dead Zone), Stephen King taught a course at the University of Maine on ""Themes in Supernatural Literature."" As he writes in the foreword to this book, he was nervous at the prospect of ""spending a lot of time in front of a lot of people talking about a subject in which I had previously only felt my way instinctively, like a blind man."" The course apparently went well, and as with most teaching experiences, it was as instructive, if not more so, to the teacher as it was to the students. Thanks to a suggestion from his former editor at Doubleday, King decided to write Danse Macabre as a personal record of the thoughts about horror that he developed and refined as a result of that course. The outcome is an utterly charming book that reads as if King were sitting right there with you, shooting the breeze. He starts on October 4, 1957, when he was 10 years old, watching a Saturday matinee of Earth vs. the Flying Saucers. Just as the saucers were mounting their attack on ""Our Nation's Capital,"" the movie was suddenly turned off. The manager of the theater walked out onto the stage and announced, ""The Russians have put a space satellite into orbit around the earth. They call it ... Spootnik."" That's how the whole book goes: one simple, yet surprisingly pertinent, anecdote or observation after another. King covers the gamut of horror as he'd experienced it at that point in 1978 (a period of about 30 years): folk tales, literature, radio, good movies, junk movies, and the ""glass teat"". It's colorful, funny, and nostalgic--and also strikingly intelligent. --Fiona Webster","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\Danse Macabre (2961)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:20+02:00","epub","9780425064627","2961","isbn:9780425064627","","Calibre Library","1983-12-01T02:00:00+02:00","Berkley","4","","1.0","3913206","General, Fiction, Horror, Criticism, Literary Criticism, Literature - Classics, American, Art, American - General, Horror in mass media","Danse Macabre","Danse Macabre","5f51777f-fedd-4899-9d4c-fb11c15b7699"
"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: Wizard and Glass, the fourth episode in King's white-hot Dark Tower series, is a sci-fi/fantasy novel that contains a post-apocalyptic Western love story twice as long. It begins with the series' star, world-weary Roland, and his world-hopping posse (an ex-junkie, a child, a plucky woman in a wheelchair, and a talking dog-like pet named Oy the Bumbler) trapped aboard a runaway train. The train is a psychotic multiple personality that intends to commit suicide with them at 800 m.p.h.--unless Roland and pals can outwit it in a riddling contest. It's a great race, for the mind and pulse. Movies should be this good. Then comes a 567-page flashback about Roland at age 14. It's a well-marbled but meaty tale. Roland and two teen homies must rescue his first love from the dirty old drooling mayor of a post-apocalyptic cowboy town, thwart a civil war by blowing up oil tanks, and seize an all-seeing crystal ball from Rhea, a vampire witch. The love scenes are startlingly prominent and earthier than most romance novels (they kiss until blood trickles from her lip). After an epic battle ending in a box canyon to end all box canyons, we're back with grizzled, grown-up Roland and the train-wreck survivors in a parallel world: Kansas in 1986, after a plague. The finale is a weird fantasy takeoff on The Wizard of Oz. Some readers will feel that the latest novel in King's most ambitious series has too many pages--almost 800--but few will deny it's a page-turner.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\Wizard and Glass (The Dark Tower, B (2962)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:20+02:00","epub","9780451194862","2962","isbn:9780451194862","","Calibre Library","2010-05-18T01:00:00+02:00","Signet","4","","1.0","1201087","General, Fiction, Fantasy, Fiction - Fantasy, Fantasy - Epic, Horror, Horror - General","Wizard and Glass (The Dark Tower, Book 4)","Wizard and Glass (The Dark Tower, Book 4)","d0acd342-7061-42ee-a2ee-525a8190aabf"

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: Beginning with a short story appearing in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1978, the publication of Stephen King's epic work of fantasy-what he considers to be a single long novel and his magnum opus-has spanned a quarter of a century. Set in a world of extraordinary circumstances, filled with stunning visual imagery and unforgettable characters, The Dark Tower series is King's most visionary feat of storytelling, a magical mix of science fiction, fantasy, and horror that may well be his crowning achievement. In November 2003, the fifth installment, Wolves of the Calla, will be published under the imprint of Donald M. Grant, with distribution and major promotion provided by Scribner. Song of Susannah, Book VI, and The Dark Tower, Book VII, will follow under the same arrangement in 2004. With these last three volumes finally on the horizon, readers-countless King readers who have yet to delve into The Dark Tower and a multitude of new and old fantasy fans-can now look forward to reading the series straight through to its stunning conclusion.

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: Many people who write about horror literature maintain that mood is its most important element. Stephen King disagrees: ""My deeply held conviction is that story must be paramount.... All other considerations are secondary--theme, mood, even characterization and language."" These fine stories, each written in what King calls ""a burst of faith, happiness, and optimism,"" prove his point. The theme, mood, characters, and language vary, but throughout, a sense of story reigns supreme. Nightmares & Dreamscapes contains 20 short tales--including several never before published--plus one teleplay, one poem, and one nonfiction piece about kids and baseball that appeared in the New Yorker. The subjects include vampires, zombies, an evil toy, man-eating frogs, the burial of a Cadillac, a disembodied finger, and a wicked stepfather. The style ranges from King's well-honed horror to a Ray Bradbury-like fantasy voice to an ambitious pastiche of Raymond Chandler and Ross MacDonald. And like a compact disc with a bonus track, the book ends with a charming little tale not listed in the table of contents--a parable called ""The Beggar and the Diamond."" --Fiona Webster","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\Nightmares and Dreamscapes (2971)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:22+02:00","epub","9780450610097","2971","isbn:9780450610097","","Calibre Library","2010-05-18T01:00:00+02:00","New English Library Ltd","4","","1.0","1025922","Fiction, Short Stories, Horror, Horror & ghost stories, Short Stories (single author), Classic fiction, Horror tales; American","Nightmares and Dreamscapes","Nightmares and Dreamscapes","f4b1453d-a939-4369-b1ec-cbec102934dd"

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: Stephen King's collection of five stories about '60s kids reads like a novel. The best is ""Low Men in Yellow Coats,"" about Bobby Garfield of Harwich, Connecticut, who craves a Schwinn for his 11th birthday. But his widowed mom is impoverished, and so bitter that she barely loves him. King is as good as Spielberg or Steven Millhauser at depicting an enchanted kid's-eye view of the world, and his Harwich is realistically luminous to the tiniest detail: kids bashing caps with a smoke-blackened rock, a car grille ""like the sneery mouth of a chrome catfish,"" a Wild Mouse carnival ride that makes kids ""simultaneously sure they were going to live forever and die immediately."" Bobby's mom takes in a lodger, Ted Brautigan, who turns the boy on to great books like Lord of the Flies. Unfortunately, Ted is being hunted by yellow-jacketed men--monsters from King's Dark Tower novels who take over the shady part of town. They close in on Ted and Bobby, just as a gang of older kids menace Bobby and his girlfriend, Carol. This pointedly echoes the theme of Lord of the Flies (the one book King says he wishes he'd written): war is the human condition. Ted's mind-reading powers rub off a bit on Bobby, granting nightmare glimpses of his mom's assault by her rich, vile, jaunty boss. King packs plenty into 250 pages, using the same trick Bobby discerns in the film Village of the Damned: ""The people seemed like real people, which made the make-believe parts scarier."" Vietnam is the otherworldly horror that haunts the remaining four stories. In the title tale, set in 1966, University of Maine college kids play the card game Hearts so obsessively they risk flunking out and getting drafted. The kids discover sex, rock, and politics, become war heroes and victims, and spend the '80s and '90s shell-shocked by change. The characters and stories are crisscrossed with connections that sometimes click and sometimes clunk. The most intense Hearts player, Ronnie Malenfant (""evil infant""), perpetrates a My Lai-like atrocity; a nice Harwich girl becomes a radical bomber. King's metaphor for lost '60s innocence is inspired by Donovan's ""sweet and stupid"" song about the sunken continent, and his stories hail the vanished Atlantis of his youth with deep sweetness and melancholy intelligence. --Tim Appelo","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\Hearts in Atlantis (2978)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:24+02:00","epub","9780671042141","2978","isbn:9780671042141","","Calibre Library","2010-05-18T01:00:00+02:00","Pocket Books","4","","1.0","589552","Fiction - General, War & Military, Short Stories (single author)","Hearts in Atlantis","Hearts in Atlantis","dfa32fa6-fbfe-4d49-aaec-e49a4d00c33d"

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: Stephen King, an evil car, and a teenage boy coming to terms with the fragility and randomness of life.... Wait, haven't we read this before? Diehard King fans, worry not. Aside from the titular car playing a main role in the story, From a Buick 8 could not be less like King's 1983 masterpiece, Christine. If anything, this story resembles King's serial novel The Green Mile, with reminiscing police characters flashing back on bizarre events that took place decades earlier. The book's intriguing plot revolves around the troopers of Pennsylvania State Patrol Troop D, who come into possession of what at first appears to be a vintage automobile. Closer inspection and experimentation conducted by the troopers reveal that this car's doors (and trunk) sometimes open to another dimension populated by gross-out creatures straight out of ... well, a Stephen King novel. As the plot progresses, the veteran troopers' tales of these visits from interdimensional nasties, and the occasional ""lightquakes"" put on by the car, are passed on to the son of a fallen comrade whose fascination with the car bordered on dangerous obsession. Unlike earlier King works, there is no active threat here; no monster is stalking the heroes of the story, unless you count the characters' own curiosity. In past books, King has terrorized readers with vampires, werewolves, a killer clown, ghosts, and aliens, but this time around, the bogeyman is a more passive, cerebral threat, and one for which they don't make a ready-to-wear Halloween costume--man's fascination with and fear of the unknown. While some readers may find this tale less exciting than the horror master's earlier works, From a Buick 8 is a wonderful example of how much King's plotting skills and literary finesse have matured over his long career. And, most of all, it's a darn creepy book. --Benjamin Reese","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\From a Buick 8 (2989)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:26+02:00","epub","9780743228473","2989","isbn:9780743228473","","Calibre Library","2002-09-23T01:00:00+02:00","Scribner","3","","1.0","387331","General, Fiction, Fantasy, Fantasy - General, Horror, Police, Horror - General, Fiction - Horror, Teenage boys, Large type books, Pennsylvania, Abandonment of automobiles, Large print books, Buick automobile","From a Buick 8","From a Buick 8","eaa3ceea-9fc8-4652-bce4-0f9ce58fdc43"

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: Stephen King fans, rejoice! The bodysnatching-aliens tale Dreamcatcher is his first book in years that slakes our hunger for horror the way he used to. A throwback to It, The Stand, and The Tommyknockers, Dreamcatcher is also an interesting new wrinkle in his fiction. Four boyhood pals in Derry, Maine, get together for a pilgrimage to their favorite deep-woods cabin, Hole in the Wall. The four have been telepathically linked since childhood, thanks to a searing experience involving a Down syndrome neighbor--a human dreamcatcher. They've all got midlife crises: clownish Beav has love problems; the intellectual shrink, Henry, is slowly succumbing to the siren song of suicide; Pete is losing a war with beer; Jonesy has had weird premonitions ever since he got hit by a car. Then comes worse trouble: an old man named McCarthy (a nod to the star of the 1956 film Invasion of the Body Snatchers) turns up at Hole in the Wall. His body is erupting with space aliens resembling furry moray eels: their mouths open to reveal nests of hatpin-like teeth. Poor Pete tries to remove one that just bit his ankle: ""Blood flew in splattery fans as Pete tried to shake it off, stippling the snow and the sawdusty tarp and the dead woman's parka. Droplets flew into the fire and hissed like fat in a hot skillet."" For all its nicely described mayhem, Dreamcatcher is mostly a psychological drama. Typically, body snatchers turn humans into zombies, but these aliens must share their host's mind, fighting for control. Jonesy is especially vulnerable to invasion, thanks to his hospital bed near-death transformation, but he's also great at messing with the alien's head. While his invading alien, Mr. Gray, is distracted by puppeteering Jonesy's body as he's driving an Arctic Cat through a Maine snowstorm, Jonesy constructs a mental warehouse along the lines of The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci. Jonesy physically feels as if he's inside a warehouse, locked behind a door with the alien rattling the doorknob and trying to trick him into letting him in. It's creepy from the alien's view, too. As he infiltrates Jonesy, experiencing sugar buzz, endorphins, and emotions for the first time, Jonesy's influence is seeping into the alien: ""A terrible thought occurred to Mr. Gray: what if it was his concepts that had no meaning?"" King renders the mental fight marvelously, and telepathy is a handy way to make cutting back and forth between the campers' various alien battlefronts crisp and cinematic. The physical naturalism of the Maine setting is matched by the psychological realism of the interior struggle. Deftly, King incorporates the real-life mental horrors of his own near-fatal accident and dramatizes the way drugs tug at your consciousness. Like the Tommyknockers, the aliens are partly symbols of King's (vanquished) cocaine and alcohol addiction. Mainly, though, they're just plain scary. Dreamcatcher is a comeback and an infusion of rich new blood into King's body of work. --Tim Appelo","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\Dreamcatcher (2992)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:27+02:00","epub","9780739416532","2992","isbn:9780739416532","","Calibre Library","2001-06-15T01:00:00+02:00","Scribner","3","","1.0","547098","Human-alien encounters, Large type books","Dreamcatcher","Dreamcatcher","9873f75a-1960-4290-8bdb-d11fc4408301"

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: In the seemingly paradisal Wisconsin town of French Landing, small distortions disturb the beauty: a talking crow, an old man obeying strange internal marching orders, a house that is both there and not quite there. And roaming the town is a terrible fiend nicknamed the Fisherman, who is abducting and murdering small children and eating their flesh. The sheriff desperately wants the help of a retired Los Angeles cop, who once collared another serial killer in a neighboring town. Of course, this is no ordinary policeman, but Jack Sawyer, hero of Stephen King and Peter Straub's 1984 fantasy The Talisman. At the end of that book, the 13-year-old Jack had completed a grueling journey through an alternate realm called the Territories, found a mysterious talisman, killed a terrible enemy, and saved the life of his mother and her counterpart in the Territories. Now in his 30s, Jack remembers nothing of the Talisman, but he also hasn't entirely forgotten: When these faces rise or those voices mutter, he has until now told himself the old lie, that once there was a frightened boy who caught his mother's neurotic terror like a cold and made up a story, a grand fantasy with good old Mom-saving Jack Sawyer at its center. None of it was real, and it was forgotten by the time he was sixteen. By then he was calm. Just as he's calm now, running across his north field like a lunatic, leaving that dark track and those clouds of startled moths behind him, but doing it calmly. Jack is abruptly pulled into the case--and back into the Territories--by the Fisherman himself, who sends Jack a child's shoe, foot still attached. As Jack flips back and forth between French Landing and the Territories, aided by his 20-years-forgotten friend Speedy Parker and a host of other oddballs (including a blind disk jockey, the beautiful mother of one of the missing children, and a motorcycle gang calling itself the ""Hegelian Scum""), he tracks both the Fisherman and a much bigger fish: the abbalah, the Crimson King who seeks to destroy the axle of worlds. While The Talisman was a straightforward myth in 1980s packaging, Black House is richer and more complex, a fantasy wrapped in a horror story inside a mystery, sporting a clever tangle of references to Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe, jazz, baseball, and King's own Dark Tower saga. Talisman fans will find the sure-footed Jack has worn well--as has the King/Straub writing style, which is much improved with the passage of two decades. --Barrie Trinkle","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\Black House (2994)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:27+02:00","epub","9780345470638","2994","isbn:9780345470638","","Calibre Library","2010-05-18T01:00:00+02:00","Ballantine Books","3","","1.0","611531","General, Fiction, Fantasy, Fantasy - General, Horror - General, Fiction - Horror","Black House","Black House","a95982c7-43b1-48c2-ad58-b88887400475"
"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: On a six-mile hike on the Maine-New Hampshire branch of the Appalachian Trail, nine-year-old Trisha McFarland quickly tires of the constant bickering between her older brother, Pete, and her recently divorced mother. But when she wanders off by herself, and then tries to catch up by attempting a shortcut, she becomes lost in a wilderness maze full of peril and terror. As night falls, Trisha has only her ingenuity as a defense against the elements, and only her courage and faith to withstand her mounting fears. For solace she tunes her Walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox baseball games and follows the gritty performances of her hero, relief pitcher Tom Gordon.

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: Beginning with a short story appearing in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1978, the publication of Stephen King's epic work of fantasy-what he considers to be a single long novel and his magnum opus-has spanned a quarter of a century. Set in a world of extraordinary circumstances, filled with stunning visual imagery and unforgettable characters, The Dark Tower series is King's most visionary feat of storytelling, a magical mix of science fiction, fantasy, and horror that may well be his crowning achievement. In November 2003, the fifth installment, Wolves of the Calla, will be published under the imprint of Donald M. Grant, with distribution and major promotion provided by Scribner. Song of Susannah, Book VI, and The Dark Tower, Book VII, will follow under the same arrangement in 2004. With these last three volumes finally on the horizon, readers-countless King readers who have yet to delve into The Dark Tower and a multitude of new and old fantasy fans-can now look forward to reading the series straight through to its stunning conclusion. Viking's elegant reissue of the first four books ensures that for the first time The Dark Tower will be widely available in hardcover editions for this eager readership.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\The Drawing of the Three (The Dark (2999)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:28+02:00","epub","9780452279612","2999","isbn:9780452279612","","Calibre Library","2010-05-18T01:00:00+02:00","Plume","4","","1.0","900813","General, Fiction, Fantasy, Epic, Fantasy fiction, Fiction - Fantasy, Fantasy - Epic, Horror, Horror & ghost stories, Roland (Fictitious character)","The Drawing of the Three (The Dark Tower, Book 2)","Drawing of the Three (The Dark Tower, Book 2), The","a468248a-495a-4b72-9873-5ba562741187"
"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: More of a mystery than a horror novel, Dolores Claiborne contains only the briefest glances at the supernatural. The novel presents Stephen King as a writer experimenting with style and narrative, time and perspective. Fans looking for a skin-crawling, page-turning fright or an undead bloodbath will be disappointed, but a patient reader willing to savor King's leisurely study of character and island life will find many rewards. And all of this is not to say that the book is without suspense. The story unfolds in one continuous chapter, told in the first person by the cranky, 65-year-old housekeeper, Dolores, who is explaining to police officers and a stenographer how and why she killed her husband, Joe, 30 years ago. At the same time, in her rambling monologue, she insists that she did not kill her longtime employer, Vera Donovan--notwithstanding what the residents of Little Tall Island may be whispering. Joe was a drinker, and, as Dolores gradually argues, he deserved to die for the horrifying crimes he committed against his family. But Vera, despite her cantankerous disposition as a lady governing her decaying estate with her precise rules about even the most mundane household chore (""Six pins! Remember to use six pins! Don't you let the wind blow my good sheets down to the corner of the yard!""), was a good woman--or at least not an evil one. She was the woman who hired the young Dolores and kept her on even after Dolores got pregnant again. Dolores cleaned and cared for her even as the old matron faded into senility. Dolores Claiborne is a rich novel that recalls the regionalist writing of the turn of the century. It is a fine place for a skeptical newcomer--put off by King's reputation for outright terror--to start. And for fans, it is a book that offers new insights into an author who's an old favorite. --Patrick O'Kelley","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\Dolores Claiborne (3000)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:29+02:00","epub","9780451177094","3000","isbn:9780451177094","","Calibre Library","1993-06-15T01:00:00+02:00","Signet Book","4","","1.0","278284","Fiction, Movie, Tv Tie-Ins, Media Tie-In - General, Media Tie-In, Horror, Horror fiction, Horror - General, Fiction - Horror, Horror tales, Women, Maine","Dolores Claiborne","Dolores Claiborne","03b999cc-ca82-417f-9919-6c1e614d9c8e"

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: In the St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers, Gary Westfahl predicts that ""King has already earned himself a place in the history of literature.... At the very least, he will enjoy the status of a latter-day Anthony Trollope, an author respected for his popularity and social commentary.... More likely, he will be enshrined as the Charles Dickens of the late 20th century, the writer who perfectly reflected, encapsulated, and expressed the characteristic concerns of his era."" If any of King's novels exemplifies his skill at portraying the concerns of his generation, it's The Dead Zone (1979). Although it contains a horrific subplot about a serial killer, it isn't strictly a horror novel. It's the story of an unassuming high school teacher, an Everyman, who suffers a gap in time--like a Rip Van Winkle who blacks out during the years 1970-75--and thus becomes acutely conscious of the way that American society is rapidly changing. He wakes up as well with a gap in his brain, the ""dead zone"" of the title. The zone gives him crippling headaches, but also grants him second sight, a talent he doesn't want and is reluctant to use. The crux of the novel concerns whether he will use that talent to alter the course of history. The Dead Zone is a tight, well-crafted book. When asked in 1983 which of his novels so far was ""the best,"" Stephen King answered, ""The one that I think works the best is Dead Zone. It's the one that [has] the most story."" --Fiona Webster","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\The Dead Zone (3015)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:31+02:00","epub","9780451126665","3015","isbn:9780451126665","","Calibre Library","2010-05-18T01:00:00+02:00","Signet","4","","1.0","407584","General, Fiction, Horror, Fiction - Horror","The Dead Zone","Dead Zone, The","ae353b57-fde0-4ced-8381-f7ca25392e66"

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: Renowned for its superior productions, BBC radio may have outdone itself by adapting Stephen King's Pet Sematary to audio. A clamorous cacophony of talking, whining, whistling, and howling, Pet Sematary is a quick, entertaining earful for those who don't have other auditory distractions to contend with, such as a car full of talking whining, whistling, howling children. However, the melodramatic prose marries well with the acting; such is the case when one reader--whose voice bears an uncanny resemblance to Kramer's from Seinfeld--tells another about the effects of the Pet Sematary: ""Heroin makes junkies feel good when they put it in their arms, but all the time it's poisoning their mind and body--this place can be like that and don't you ever forget it!""

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: Roland Deschain and his ka-tet are bearing southeast through the forests of Mid-World, the almost timeless landscape that seems to stretch from the wreckage of civility that defined Roland's youth to the crimson chaos that seems the future's only promise. Followers of Stephen King's epic series know Roland well, or as well as this enigmatic hero can be known. They also know the companions who have been drawn to his quest for the Dark Tower: Eddie Dean and his wife, Susannah; Jake Chambers, the boy who has come twice through the doorway of death into Roland's world; and Oy, the Billy Bumbler. In this long-awaited fifth novel in the saga, their path takes them to the outskirts of Calla Bryn Sturgis, a tranquil valley community of farmers and ranchers on Mid-World's borderlands. Beyond the town the rocky ground rises towards the hulking darkness of Thunderclap, the source of a terrible affliction that is slowly stealing the community's soul. One of the town's residents is Pere Callahan, a ruined priest who, like Susannah, Eddie and Jake, passed through one of the portals that lead both into and out of Roland's world. As Father Callahan tells the ka-tet the astonishing story of what happened following his shamed departure from Maine in 1977, his connection to the Dark Tower becomes clear, as does the danger facing a single red rose in a vacant lot off Second Avenue in midtown Manhattan. For Calla Bryn Sturgis, danger gathers in the east like a storm cloud. The Wolves of Thunderclap and their unspeakable depredation are coming. To resist them is to risk all, but these are odds the gunslingers are used to, and they can give the Calla folken both courage and cunning. Their guns, however, will not be enough.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\Wolves of the Calla (The Dark Tower (3031)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:34+02:00","epub","9780340827154","3031","isbn:9780340827154","","Calibre Library","2010-05-18T01:00:00+02:00","Hodder and Stoughton","4","","1.0","604806","Science fiction, Fiction, Fantasy, Modern fiction, Horror & ghost stories","Wolves of the Calla (The Dark Tower, Book 5)","Wolves of the Calla (The Dark Tower, Book 5)","d95eb8af-0bdd-4fea-bd9b-2f0e733918bd"

The next month there was a scream of ecstatic agony from the woman attacked in her snug bedroom. Now scenes of unbelieving horror come each time the full moon shines on the isolated Maine town of Tarker Mills. No one knows who will be attacked next. But one thing is sure. When the moon grows fat, a paralyzing fear sweeps through Tarker Mills. For snarls that sound like human words can be heard whining through the wind.

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: Why read Carrie? Stephen King himself has said that he finds his early work ""raw,"" and Brian De Palma's movie was so successful that we feel like we have read the novel even if we never have. The simple answer is that this is a very scary story, one that works as well--if not better--on the page as on the screen. Carrie White, menaced by bullies at school and her religious nut of a mother at home, gradually discovers that she has telekinetic powers, powers that will eventually be turned on her tormentors. King has a way of getting under the skin of his readers by creating an utterly believable world that throbs with menace before finally exploding. He builds the tension in this early work by piecing together extracts from newspaper reports, journals, and scientific papers, as well as more traditional first- and third-person narrative in order to reveal what lurks beneath the surface of Chamberlain, Maine. News item from the Westover (ME) weekly Enterprise, August 19, 1966: ""Rain of Stones Reported: It was reliably reported by several persons that a rain of stones fell from a clear blue sky on Carlin Street in the town of Chamberlain on August 17th."" Although the supernatural pyrotechnics are handled with King's customary aplomb, it is the carefully drawn portrait of the little horrors of small towns, high schools, and adolescent sexuality that give this novel its power, and assures its place in the King canon. --Simon Leake","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\Carrie (3035)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:35+02:00","epub","9780451072801","3035","isbn:9780451072801","","Calibre Library","2010-05-18T01:00:00+02:00","Signet","4","","1.0","177051","General, Fiction","Carrie","Carrie","c3a787d9-a91a-4d5f-9664-3a8316783d0c"

The Unified Authority controls Earth's colonies with an iron fist and a powerful military-a military made up almost entirely of clones...*    Private first-class Wayson Harris was raised in a U.A. orphanage among thousands of clones born and bred as the ultimate soldiers. But Harris isn't like the other Marines: he has a mind of his own. He figures he's paying for that independent streak when his first assignment out of boot camp is the smallest Marine outpost in the whole U.A.    When a rogue general surfaces, the remote desert world Harris thought was a dead-end posting becomes anything but. Fighting off the general's raid gains Harris a promotion. But it also brings him to the attention of some unfriendly U.A. leaders. They have their own plans for the military-plans Harris disrupts by his very existence. For in an army of clones, the one unforgivable sin is to be different...    In his debut novel, Steven L.

But unlike the others, Harris is an outlawed model-one with independent thoughts and an addiction to violence.    Presumed dead after his troops were massacred, Harris-who blames the U.A. for the slaughter-has gone AWOL as a bounty hunter. Still, it's hard for a clone to overcome his conditioning, and Harris finds himself drawn back into the U.A.'s service by his mentor and creator, Fleet Admiral Bryce Klyber.    Now, with separatists rebelling throughout the galaxy, the fate of the U.A. depends on Admiral Klyber's plans for the Doctrinaire-the largest, most powerful battleship ever constructed. But there are those who would do anything to stop Klyber, and Harris must decide whether he should fight against them...or work for them.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Steven L.

"Kawasaki, Guy","Kawasaki, Guy","### From Publishers Weekly  Kawasaki (*Rules for Revolutionaries*) draws upon his dual background as an evangelist for Apple's Macintosh computer and as a Silicon Valley venture capitalist in this how-to for launching any type of business project. Each chapter begins with ""GIST"" (""great ideas for starting things""), covering a variety of facets to consider, from identifying your customer base and writing a business plan to establishing partnerships and building brand identity. Minichapters zero in on particular jobs that will need doing, while FAQ sections address the questions readers are most likely to have: Kawasaki covers the basics in an effectively casual tone. Much of the advice, however, consists of generic banalities—start your company's name with a letter that comes early in the alphabet, use big type in presentation slides for older businessmen with declining eyesight, and avoid writing e-mails in all capital letters—that can be found in any mediocre guide. Fortunately, Kawasaki does rise to the occasion here and there. He goes into great detail when it comes to raising capital and offers effective methods for sorting through the nonsense associated with interviewing prospective employees.

Nicknamed The Grandmother of Science  Fiction, or The Little Mother of Science Fiction, she burst onto the scene in 1948 with a  disturbing story about nuclear radiation. She was also a passionate social and political activist. In  fact, her life was a constant adventure within the alternative and experimental worlds of science  fiction, politics and literature.  She died in 1997.  Written by her granddaughter, this loving  memoir and biography is illustrated with  * original art works * covers from classic science  fiction magazines * period illustrations * personal and art photographs  Though Judith Merril's  classic books are now out-of-print, they are widely available in libraries and used book stores;  and first editions of her work are quite collectible.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Judith\Better to Have Loved_ The Life of J (3083)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:44+02:00","epub","9781896357577","3083","isbn:9781896357577","","Calibre Library","2002-04-19T01:00:00+02:00","Between the Lines(CA)","","","1.0","351652","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Literary Criticism, Literary, Biography & Autobiography, Autobiography, Biography: general, 20th century, Biography, Language Arts & Disciplines, Authors; American, Authors; Canadian (English) 20th century Biography, Merril; Judith; 1923, Authors; Canadian, Politics & government, Merril; Judith; 1923-, Authorship, Canadian, Biography: Historical; Political & Military, Literature: Texts, American","Better to Have Loved: The Life of Judith Merril","Better to Have Loved: The Life of Judith Merril","3ec3d5eb-3925-4561-bcd6-d5bfdd0b3617"

And now, too late to change her mind and get out, with the metal walls pressing in around her, they lunged sharply downwards.

Amid the tragic unfolding mayhem of the morning of 9/11, failed Brighton businessman and ne'er-do-well Ronnie Wilson sees the chance of a lifetime, to shed his debts, disappear and reinvent himself in another country.

At least, that's the way it looks to Detective Superintendent Roy Grace who is called in to investigate the kinky slaying of beautiful young Brighton socialite, Katie Bishop. Soon, Grace starts coming to the conclusion that Bishop has performed the apparently impossible feat of being in two places at once. Has someone stolen his identity, or is he simply a very clever liar? As Grace digs deeper behind the facade of the Bishops' outwardly respectable lives, it starts to become clear that all is not at all as it first seemed. And then he digs just a little too far, and suddenly the fragile stability of his own troubled, private world is facing destruction . . .

"Jacobs, A. J.","A. J. Jacobs","From the bestselling author of *The Year of Living Biblically* and *The Know-It-All* comes the truly hilarious story of one person’s quest to become the healthiest man in the world. 
Hospitalized with a freak case of tropical pneumonia and ashamed of a middle-aged body best described as “a python that swallowed a goat,” A.J. Jacobs felt compelled to change his ways and get healthy. To accomplish this epic task, he consulted an army of experts and subjected himself to dozens of different workouts, diets, and devices—from Finger Fitness to Strollercize sessions, veganism to extreme chewing. 
The story of his transformation is not only brilliantly entertaining, but it just may be the healthiest book ever written. It will make you laugh until your sides split and endorphins flood your bloodstream. It will move you emotionally and get you moving physically in surprising ways. It will serve you up today’s best health advice. And it will give you occasion to reflect on the body’s many mysteries and the ultimate pursuit of health: a well-lived life.
### Amazon.com Review
 **Amazon Best Books of the Month, April 2012** : You may know A.J. Jacobs as the man who attempted to read the *Encyclopedia Britannica* from cover-to-cover. Or you may have been introduced to him when he spent a year trying to follow the Bible as literally as possible. He returns once again with another seemingly impossible task--that of becoming the healthiest man alive. As with his earlier books, Jacobs brings his quick wit, self-deprecating humor, and journalistic eye to the experiment. He leaves no health stone unturned: from literally running his errands and wearing noise-cancelling headphones for hours a day to rigging a desk that he can work at while walking on the treadmill (there are instructions at the end for those interested), Jacobs chronicles the good, bad, and ugly of trying to attain “perfect” health. Jacobs’ writing is breezy, informational, and entertaining, and he manages to achieve the near impossible--discussing issues of health without sounding preachy. *\--Caley Anderson*
### Review
""A.J. Jacobs is very, very bad for your health. He will keep you up reading til 2 a.m., disturbing your circadian rhythms, making you sleep through breakfast and overeat at lunch. He is delicious. He's habit-forming. He will give you infectious titters and terminal glee. Don't let that stop you. Indulge.""— **Mary Roach, author of *Bonk* and *Packing for Mars***  

“We can become healthier by learning from AJ's discomfort in this very funny book. He moves us from theory to practice by dragging his body through all the longevity practices.”— **Dr. Mehmet Oz, host, ""The Dr. Oz Show""**  

“I couldn’t wait to get my hands on this book, and once again, the brilliant A.J. Jacobs had me laughing out loud—and also deciding to change the way I live. *Drop Dead Healthy* is a rare mixture of the hilarious, the absurd, and the scientifically sound. Who knew it could be so entertaining to read about broccoli puree and shoeless jogging?”— **Gretchen Rubin, author of *The Happiness Project** *  

""Can one man go from a 'python that ate a goat' physique to perfect specimen? From Roman soldier workouts to Areca palm plants, from the sublime to the absurd, A.J. has tried it all. I laughed my ass off the wholeway and learned a ton ... including about my ass.""— **Timothy Ferriss, author of *The 4-Hour Workweek** *  

""Who wouldn't want to be fitter, happier, more productive? In this riotous, madcap book, A.J. Jacobs sets himself an ambitious goal: to become the person we all wish we could be. It's vintage A.J. Do your future self a favor and read this book."" — **Joshua Foer, author of *Moonwalking with Einstein** *  

""You'll burn calories laughing out loud."" **—*Shape** *  

“While Jacobs’s attempts at health enlightenment can be hilarious, visits with his grandfather, famed labor lawyer Theodore Kheel, provide the most revealing glimpse into the secrets of aging well.” **—*More** *  

""Jacobs' light touch camouflages the impressive amount of research that goes into each chapter. He reads books and medical reports, interviews experts and scientists as well as enthusiasts on the fringe, then tries everything himself. He brings a skeptic's eye to each point of view, but he remains respectful of even the wackiest ideas... Yes, the results are funny, but this is, at heart, a serious book, with an underlying poignancy: As Jacobs works to get healthier, his beloved grandfather begins his slow decline, reminding us that no matter how healthy we are, it's all going to end the same way **.** "" **—Laurie Hertzl, *The Minneapolis Star Tribune** *  

""You'll exercise your abdominals laughing over his adventures."" **— ** * **Entertainment Weekly***  

“Why go to the gym when you can sit and read a funny book about it instead?” *— **USA Today***

"Irvine, Alex","Alex Irvine","SUMMARY: The Ultimates are a cadre of Super Heroes employed by the U.S. government to face threats to humanity too powerful for conventional operatives to handle. Led by General Nick Fury, the roster includes billionaire playboy Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man; Captain America, a World War II super-soldier whom fate has thrust into the twenty-first century; an environmental activist who claims to be the Norse god Thor; and Janet Pym, a scientist whose mutant powers allow her to shrink to the size of a wasp.The alien shapeshifters called the Chitauri were defeated by the Ultimates in a decisive battle, but suspicious activity leads the Ultimates to believe that not all of the aliens were destroyed in that cataclysmic attack. Stark Industries has developed a means of quickly and easily detecting Chitauri DNA, but the federal government refuses to adopt the technology, claiming that if the tech is widely available, the Chitauri will find a way to fool it.Frustrated by the government's seeming unwillingness to protect its own people, Captain America takes matters into his own hands, leaking the technology so that it can be manufactured and distributed throughout the country. His radical actions sow discord among the Ultimates and within the highest levels of government, raising a troubling question: Could this disunity and chaos be playing right into the Chitauri's hands?Meanwhile, Hank Pym, who desperately wants back on the Ultimates team, has been feverishly experimenting with his ants in the hopes of finding his own alternate method of detecting the Chitauri. When he appears to be successful, it could spell doom for the alien menace -- but only if the Ultimates can finally set aside their differences long enough to recognize their true enemy....","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Alex Irvine\The Ultimates_ Against All Enemies (3121)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:48:52+02:00","epub","9781416510710","3121","isbn:9781416510710","","Calibre Library","2007-08-27T21:30:00+02:00","Pocket Star","","","1.0","179063","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Adventure, Science Fiction - Adventure, Movie, Human-alien encounters, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Tv Tie-Ins, Movie-TV Tie-In - General, Media Tie-In - General, Heroes, Comics & Graphic Novels, United States, Movie or Television Tie-In, General & Literary Fiction, Media Tie-In","The Ultimates: Against All Enemies (Ultimates)","Ultimates: Against All Enemies (Ultimates), The","71105f18-5ace-41b3-b6ec-d879cd52521f"

"Hoppe, Hans-Hermann","Hans-Hermann Hoppe","<p>The core of this book is a systematic treatment of the historic transformation of the West from monarchy to democracy. Revisionist in nature, it reaches the conclusion that monarchy is a lesser evil than democracy, but outlines deficiencies in both. Its methodology is axiomatic-deductive, allowing the writer to derive economic and sociological theorems, and then apply them to interpret historical events.</p> <p>A compelling chapter on time preference describes the progress of civilization as lowering time preferences as capital structure is built, and explains how the interaction between people can lower time all around, with interesting parallels to the Ricardian Law of Association. By focusing on this transformation, the author is able to interpret many historical phenomena, such as rising levels of crime, degeneration of standards of conduct and morality, and the growth of the mega-state. In underscoring the deficiencies of both monarchy and democracy, the author demonstrates how these systems are both inferior to a natural order based on private-property.</p> <p>Hoppe deconstructs the classical liberal belief in the possibility of limited government and calls for an alignment of conservatism and libertarianism as natural allies with common goals. He defends the proper role of the production of defense as undertaken by insurance companies on a free market, and describes the emergence of private law among competing insurers. Having established a natural order as superior on utilitarian grounds, the author goes on to assess the prospects for achieving a natural order. Informed by his analysis of the deficiencies of social democracy, and armed with the social theory of legitimation, he forsees secession as the likely future of the US and Europe, resulting in a multitude of region and city-states. This book complements the author's previous work defending the ethics of private property and natural order. <em>Democracy</em>—<em>The God that Failed </em>will be of interest to scholars and students of history, political economy, and political philosophy.</p> <p>**</p></html>","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Hans-Hermann Hoppe\DemocracyThe God That Failed_ The E (3187)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:49:05+02:00","epub","9780765808684","3187","amazon:0765808684,isbn:9780765808684,google:qARC56X5vxcC","eng","Calibre Library","2001-07-30T02:00:00+02:00","Transaction Publishers","5","","1.0","1852485","History, Europe, Scandinavia, Political Science, Political Economy, History & Theory","DemocracyThe God That Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order","DemocracyThe God That Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order","d98dbbfe-d402-40b3-985c-a1ef983faf4a"

And this has profound consequences -- on our health, our job performance, our relationships and our happiness.What is needed, she boldly asserts, is nothing short of a sleep revolution.  Only by renewing our relationship with sleep can we take back control of our lives.<br><br> In her bestseller <i>Thrive</i>,Arianna wrote about our need to redefine success through well-being, wisdom, wonder, and giving. Her discussion of the importance of sleep as a gateway to this more fulfilling way of living struck such a powerful chord that she realized the mystery and transformative power of sleep called for a fuller investigation.<br><br> The result is a sweeping, scientifically rigorous, and deeply personal exploration of sleep from all angles, from the history of sleep, to the role of dreams in our lives, to the consequences of sleep deprivation,...","","2025-06-01T00:49:06+02:00","epub","","3190","","eng","Calibre Library","2016-04-05T00:00:00+02:00","Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony","","","1.0","675744","","The Sleep Revolution","Sleep Revolution, The","e7e8b94d-9a11-434c-acdc-b7d9980c96d5"

"Holiday, Ryan","Ryan Holiday","You’ve seen it all before. A malicious online rumor costs a company millions. A political sideshow derails the national news cycle and destroys a candidate. Some product or celebrity zooms from total obscurity to viral sensation. What you don’t know is that someone is responsible for all this. Usually, someone like me.
I’m a media manipulator. In a world where blogs control and distort the news, my job is to control blogs—as much as any one person can.
In today’s culture…   
1) Blogs like *Gawker* , *Buzzfeed* and the *Huffington Post* drive the media agenda.  
2) Bloggers are slaves to money, technology, and deadlines.  
3) Manipulators wield these levers to shape everything you read, see and watch—online and off.
Why am I giving away these secrets? Because I'm tired of a world where blogs take indirect bribes, marketers help write the news, reckless journalists spread lies, and no one is accountable for any of it. I'm pulling back the curtain because I don't want anyone else to get blindsided.  

I’m going to explain exactly how the media *really* works. What you choose to do with this information is up to you.
### Review
“Holiday is part Machiavelli, part Ogilvy, and all results…this whiz kid is the secret weapon you’ve never heard of.”
 **—Tim Ferriss, author of *The 4-Hour Workweek** *
 **
“Essential reading.”
 **—Andrew Keen**
“Ryan Holiday's brilliant exposé of the unreality of the Internet should be required reading for every thinker in America.”
 **— Edward Jay Epstein, author of *The Big Picture** *  

“The strategies Ryan created to exploit blogs drove sales of millions of my books and made me an internationally known name.”
 **—Tucker Max**  

“Behind my reputation as marketing genius there is Ryan Holiday, whom I consult often and has done more for my business than just about anyone.”
 **—Dov Charney, CEO and founder, American Apparel**  

“Holiday has written more than a dyspeptic diatribe, as his precise prose and reference to the scholarship of others add weight to his claims. A sharp and disturbing look into the world of online reality.”
 **—*Kirkus Reviews** *  

“His focus is prescient and his schemes compelling. Media students and bloggers would do well to heed Holiday’s informative, timely, and provocative advice.”
 **—*Publishers Weekly** *  

“While the observation that the Internet favors speed over accuracy is hardly new, Holiday lays out how easily it is to twist it toward any end… *Trust Me, I’m Lying* provides valuable food for thought regarding how we receive — and perceive — information.”
 **—*New York** Post ****  

*“This is an astonishing book. Holiday has worked for several years as a self-proclaimed media manipulator, running campaigns for companies such as American Apparel. He is now intent on revealing the tricks that his kind use to influence us. Many of these stories are chilling.”
 **—Gillian Tett, *Financial Times** *

Except, that is, for the time it had eaten the secondhand Buick . . .But now, all of a sudden and without explanation, Lummox had begun chomping down on a variety of things -- not least, a very mean dog and a cage of virtually indestructible steel. Incredible!John Thomas and Lummox were soon in awfully hot water, and they didn't know how to get out. And neither one really understood just how bad things were -- or how bad the situation could get -- until some space voyagers appeared and turned a far-from-ordinary family problem into an extraordinary confrontation.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Robert A.

Heinlein & Spider Robinson","SUMMARY: A never-before-published masterpiece from science fiction’s greatest writer, rediscovered after more than half a century.When Joel Johnston first met Jinny Hamilton, it seemed like a dream come true. And when she finally agreed to marry him, he felt like the luckiest man in the universe. There was just one small problem. He was broke. His only goal in life was to become a composer, and he knew it would take years before he was earning enough to support a family. But Jinny wasn’t willing to wait. And when Joel asked her what they were going to do for money, she gave him a most unexpected answer. She told him that her name wasn’t really Jinny Hamilton---it was Jinny Conrad, and she was the granddaughter of Richard Conrad, the wealthiest man in the solar system.And now that she was sure that Joel loved her for herself, not for her wealth, she revealed her family’s plans for him---he would be groomed for a place in the vast Conrad empire and sire a dynasty to carry on the family business.Most men would have jumped at the opportunity. But Joel Johnston wasn’t most men. To Jinny’s surprise, and even his own, he turned down her generous offer and then set off on the mother of all benders. And woke up on a colony ship heading out into space, torn between regret over his rash decision and his determination to forget Jinny and make a life for himself among the stars.He was on his way to succeeding when his plans--and the plans of billions of others--were shattered by a cosmic cataclysm so devastating it would take all of humanity’s strength and ingenuity just to survive.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Robert A.

"Hartwell, David G.","David G. Hartwell","SUMMARY: ""Science fiction is the characteristic literary genre of the century. It is the genre that stands in opposition to literary modernism."" So says David G. Hartwell in his introduction to The Science Fiction Century, an anthology spanning a hundred years of science fiction, from its birth in the 1890s to the future it predicted.David G. Hartwell is a World Fantasy Award-winning editor and anthologist who has twice before redefined a genre--first the horror field with The Dark Descent, then the subgenre of hard science fiction with The Ascent of Wonder, coedited with Kathryn Cramer. Now, Hartwell has compiled the mother of all definitive anthologies, guaranteed to change not only the way the science fiction field views itself but also the way the rest of literature views the field.The Science Fiction Century includes stories from the founding fathers of the field, such as H.G. Wells, C.S. Lewis, Jack London, and Rudyard Kipling; beloved mainstays of the genre, such as Philip José Farmer, Roger Zelazny, Jack Vance, and Poul Anderson; noted female writers, including Connie Willis, Nancy Kress, and James Tiptree, Jr.; and writers who have hit their stride in the last two decades, such as Bruce Sterling, William Gibson, Michael Swanwick, and James Morrow. Hartwell has also included writers widely recognized outside the genre, such as E.M. Forster, Michael Shaara, and John Crowley; and translations of foreign writers' formative works, including Dino Buzzati and Wolfgang Jeschke. This is must-have anthology for all literary interests.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\David G.

John Harrison","SUMMARY: Years after Ed Chianese’s fateful trip into the Kefahuchi Tract, the tract has begun to expand and change in ways we never could have predicted—and, even more terrifying, parts of it have actually begun to fall to Earth, transforming the landscapes they encounter.Not far from Moneytown, in a neighborhood of underground clubs, body-modification chop shops, adolescent contract killers, and sexy streetwalking Monas, you’ll find the Saudade Event Site: a zone of strange geography, twisted physics, and frightening psychic onslaughts—not to mention the black and white cats that come pouring out at irregular intervals. Vic Serotonin is a “travel agent” into and out of Saudade. His latest client is a woman who’s nearly as unpredictable as the site itself—and maybe just as dangerous. She wants a tour just as a troubling new class of biological artifacts are leaving the site—living algorithms that are transforming the world outside in inexplicable and unsettling ways. Shadowed by a metaphysically inclined detective determined to shut his illegal operation down, Vic must make sense of a universe rapidly veering toward a virulent and viral form of chaos…and a humanity almost lost.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\M.

"Harrison, Harry","Harry Harrison","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  from the introductory:                   ""It might seem a little careless to lose                  track of something as big as a battleship ...                  but interstellar space is on a different scale                  of magnitude. But a misplaced battleship                 -in the wrong hands!                 -can be most dangerous.""         WHEN it comes to picking locks and cracking safes I admit to no master. The door to Inskipp's private quarters had an old-fashioned tumbler drum that was easier to pick than my teeth. I must have gone through that door without breaking step. Quiet as I was though, Inskipp still heard me. The light came on and there he was sitting up in bed pointing a .75 caliber recoilless at my sternum.   ""You should have more brains than that, diGriz,"" he snarled. ""Creeping into my room at night! You could have been shot.""   ""No I couldn't,"" I told him, as he stowed the cannon back under his pillow. ""A man with a curiosity bump as big as yours will always talk first and shoot later. And besides-none of this pussyfooting around in the dark would be necessary if your screen was open and I could have got a call through.""   Inskipp yawned and poured himself a glass of water from the dispenser unit above the bed. ""Just because I head the Special Corps, doesn't mean that I *am* the Special Corps,"" he said moistly while he drained the glass. ""I have to sleep sometime. My screen is open only for emergency calls, not for every agent who needs his hand held.""   ""Meaning I am in the hand-holding category?"" I asked with as much sweetness as I could.   ""Put yourself in any category you please,"" he grumbled as he slumped down in the bed. ""And also put yourself out into the hall and see me tomorrow during working hours.""   He was at my mercy, really. He wanted sleep so much. And he was going to be wide awake so very soon.   ""Do you know what this is?"" I asked him, poking a large glossy pic under his long broken nose. One eye opened slowly.   ""Big warship of some kind, looks like Empire lines. Now for the last time-go away!"" he said.   ""A very good guess for this late at night,"" I told him cheerily. ""It is a late Empire battleship of the Warlord class. Undoubtedly one of the most truly efficient engines of destruction ever manufactured. Over a half mile of defensive screens and armament, that could probably turn any fleet existent today into fine radioactive ash-""   ""Except for the fact that the last one was broken up for scrap over a thousand years ago,"" he mumbled.   I leaned over and put my lips close to his ear. So there would be no chance of misunderstanding. Speaking softly, but clearly.   ""True, true,"" I said. ""But wouldn't you be just a *little* bit interested if I was to tell you that one is being built today?""   Oh, it was beautiful to watch. The covers went one way and Inskipp went the other. In a single unfolding, in concerted motion he left the horizontal and recumbent and stood tensely vertical against the wall. Examining the pic of the battleship under the light. He apparently did not believe in pajama bottoms and it hurt me to see the goose-bumps rising on those thin shanks. But if the legs were thin, the voice was more than full enough to make up for the difference.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Harry Harrison\The Misplaced Battleship (3277)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:49:25+02:00","epub","9781437857986","3277","isbn:9781437857986","eng","Calibre Library","2008-11-12T02:00:00+02:00","IndyPublish","","","1.0","162074","General, Fiction, General & Literary Fiction, Fiction - General, Modern & contemporary fiction (post c 1945)","The Misplaced Battleship","Misplaced Battleship, The","342b5df4-0265-4280-83bb-689f5905bc81"

"Harrison, Harry","Harry Harrison","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  from the introductory:                  ""Speed never hurt anybody-it's the sudden                  stop at the end. It's not how much change                  that signals danger, but how fast it's changing....""      WE'RE losing a planet, Neel. I'm afraid that I can't ... understand it.""   The bald and wrinkled head wobbled a bit on the thin neck, and his eyes were moist. Abravanel was a very old man. Looking at him, Neel realized for the first time just how old and close to death he was. It was a profoundly shocking thought.   ""Pardon me, sir,"" Neel broke in, ""but is it possible? To lose a planet, I mean. If the readings are done correctly, and the k-factor equations worked to the tenth decimal place, then it's really just a matter of adjustment, making the indicated corrections. After all, Societics is an exact science-""   ""Exact? *Exact!* Of course it's not! Have I taught you so little that you dare say that to me?"" Anger animated the old man, driving the shadow of death back a step or two.   Neel hesitated, feeling his hands quiver ever so slightly, groping for the right words. Societics was his faith, and his teacher, Abravanel, its only prophet. This man before him, carefully preserved by the age-retarding drugs, was unique in the galaxy. A living anachronism, a refugee from the history books. Abravanel had singlehandedly worked out the equations, spelled out his science of Societics. Then he had trained seven generations of students in its fundamentals. Hearing the article of his faith defamed by its creator produced a negative feedback loop in Neel so strong his hands vibrated in tune with it. It took a jarring effort to crack out of the cycle.   ""The laws that control Societics, as postulated by ... you, are as exact as any others in the unified-field theory universe.""   ""No they're not. And, if any man I taught believes that nonsense, I'm retiring tomorrow and dropping dead the day after. My science-and it is really not logical to call it a science-is based on observation, experimentation, control groups and corrected observations. And though we have made observations in the millions, we are dealing in units in the billions, and the interactions of these units are multiples of that. And let us never forget that our units are people who, when they operate as individuals, do so in a completely different manner. So you cannot truthfully call my theories exact. They fit the facts well enough and produce results in practice, that has been empirically proven. So far. Some day, I am sure, we will run across a culture that doesn't fit my rules. At that time the rules will have to be revised. We may have that situation now on Himmel. There's trouble cooking there.""

The weres and shifters have finally decided to reveal their existence to the ordinary world. At first all goes well. Then the mutilated body of a were-panther is found near the bar where Sookie works-and she feels compelled to discover who, human or otherwise, did it. But there's a far greater danger threatening Bon Temps. A race of unhuman beings-older, more powerful, and more secretive than vampires or werewolves-is preparing for war.

"Harris, Anne","Anne Harris","SUMMARY: Anne Harris's second novel welcomes readers to the Detroit of the future--a city of extreme poverty and extravagant wealth, were every life is overshadowed by the megalithic biotech corporation GeneSys. With the rise of maglev transportation and the death of the auto industry, the name Motor City has become an anachronism. There are no jobs except GeneSys jobs. One can either pass an exam and obtain an office job at GeneSys headquarters or work in the dangerous biopolymer-growing vats in Vattown. Chango Chichelski, a sport (a mutant from exposure to lethal growth medium in the vats) with a passionate love of the Detroit of her grandmother's stories, chooses instead to fall through the cracks. Chango lives in an ancient motor car and spends her time haunting (and committing to memory) buildings slated for demolition. Her life changes when she rescues, and then falls in love with, a fanged and four-armed sport named Helix. Helix is the adopted daughter of Hector Martin, the brilliant but emotionally unstable head scientist at GeneSys. Weary of her isolated life, Helix flees into Vattown, intending to become a vat diver. But her plan is opposed by Chango, whose union-organizer sister Ada died after contact with the vat's growth medium, and by the vat divers themselves, who refuse to accept a sport within their ranks. Accidental Creatures is an action-packed tale full of intrigue, betrayals, and flashy characters. Interestingly, the sports of the Vattown underworld--drug dealers, junk artists, and healers--look positively normal compared to GeneSys's corporate denizens, who scream, cry, fight, and lie outrageously to retain or advance their positions in the corporate hierarchy. Harris's writing style is not for everybody (for instance, readers allergic to comma splices should approach with caution). But for the less grammatically persnickety, Accidental Creatures may prove to be a rewarding tale of outsiders and identity. --Eddy Avery","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Anne Harris\Accidental Creatures (3296)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:49:29+02:00","epub","9780312875602","3296","isbn:9780312875602","","Calibre Library","2000-10-06T01:00:00+02:00","Tor Books","","","1.0","265651","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, High Tech, Mutation (Biology), Biopolymers","Accidental Creatures","Accidental Creatures","759059c7-bb0d-47d4-bbc4-026855dbc203"

"Chelsea, Handler,","Handler, Chelsea","**In this raucous collection of true-life stories, actress and comedian Chelsea Handler recounts her time spent in the social trenches with that wild, strange, irresistible, and often gratifying beast: the one-night stand.** You've either done it or know someone who has: the one-night stand, the familiar outcome of a night spent at a bar, sometimes the sole payoff for your friend's irritating wedding, or the only relief from a disastrous vacation. Often embarrassing and uncomfortable, occasionally outlandish, but most times just a necessary and irresistible evil, the one-night stand is a social rite as old as sex itself and as common as a bar stool. Enter Chelsea Handler. Gorgeous, sharp, and anything but shy, Chelsea loves men and lots of them. My Horizontal Life chronicles her romp through the different bedrooms of a variety of suitors, a no-holds-barred account of what can happen between a man and a sometimes very intoxicated, outgoing woman during one night of passion. From her short fling with a Vegas stripper to her even shorter dalliance with a well-endowed little person, from her uncomfortable tryst with a cruise ship performer to her misguided rebound with a man who likes to play leather dress-up, Chelsea recalls the highs and lows of her one-night stands with hilarious honesty.

"Haldeman, Joe W.","Joe Haldeman","SUMMARY: In the 1970s Joe Haldeman approached more than a dozen different publishers before he finally found one interested in The Forever War. The book went on to win both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, although a large chunk of the story had been cut out before it saw publication. Now Haldeman and Avon Books have released the definitive version of The Forever War, published for the first time as Haldeman originally intended. The book tells the timeless story of war, in this case a conflict between humanity and the alien Taurans. Humans first bumped heads with the Taurans when we began using collapsars to travel the stars. Although the collapsars provide nearly instantaneous travel across vast distances, the relativistic speeds associated with the process means that time passes slower for those aboard ship. For William Mandella, a physics student drafted as a soldier, that means more than 27 years will have passed between his first encounter with the Taurans and his homecoming, though he himself will have aged only a year. When Mandella finds that he can't adjust to Earth after being gone so long from home, he reenlists, only to find himself shuttled endlessly from battle to battle as the centuries pass. --Craig E.

"Grove, Andrew S.","Andrew S. Grove","SUMMARY: Under Andy Grove's leadership, Intel has become the world's largest chipmaker, the fifth-most-admired company in America, and the seventh-most-profitable company among the Fortune 500. You don't achieve rankings like these unless you have mastered a rare understanding of the art of business and an unusual way with its practice.Few CEOs can claim this level of consistent record-breaking success. Grove attributes much of this success to the philosophy and strategy he reveals in Only the Paranoid Survive--a book that is unique in leadership annals for offering a bold new business measure, and for taking the reader deep inside the workings of a major corporation. Grove's contribution to business thinking concerns a new way of measuring the nightmare moment every leader dreads--the moment when massive change occurs and all bets are off. The success you had the day before is gone, destroyed by unforeseen changes that hit like a stage-six rapid. Grove calls such moments Strategic Inflection Points, and he has lived through several. When SlPs hit, all rules of business shift fast, furiously, and forever. SlPs can be set off by almost anything--megacompetition, an arcane change in regulations, or a seemingly modest change in technology.Yet in the watchful leader's hand, SlPs can be an ace. Managed right, a company can turn a SIP into a positive force to win in the marketplace and emerge stronger than ever.To achieve that level of mastery over change, you must know its properties inside and out. Grove addresses questions such as these: What are the stages of these tidal waves? What sources do you turn to in order to foresee dangers before trouble announces itself? When threats abound, how do you deal with your emotions, your calendar, your career--as well as with your most loyal managers and customers, who may cling to tradition?No stranger to risk, Grove examines his own record of success and failure, including the drama of how he navigated the events of the Pentium flaw, which threatened Intel in a major way, and how he is dealing with the SIP brought on by the Internet. The work of a lifetime of reflection, Only the Paranoid Survive is a contemporary classic of leadership skills.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Andrew S.

"John, Grisham,","Grisham, John","Before he was sent to federal prison for treason (among other things), Joel Backman was an extremely powerful man. Known as ""the broker,"" Backman was a high roller--a lawyer making $10 million a year who could ""open any door in Washington."" That is, until he tried to broker a deal selling access to the world's most powerful satellite surveillance system to the highest bidder. When caught, Backman accepted prison as the one option that would keep him safe and alive, since the interested parties (the Israelis, the Saudis, the Russians, and the Chinese) were all itching to get their hands on his secrets at any cost. Little does he know that his own government has designs on accessing that information--or at least letting it die with him. Now, six years after his incarceration, the director of the CIA convinces a lame duck president to pardon Backman, and the broker becomes a free man--and an open target.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Grisham, John\The Broker (3319)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:49:37+02:00","epub","","3319","","","Calibre Library","2010-06-10T06:00:00+02:00","","","","1.0","282493","","The Broker","Broker, The","df1f81f5-4542-4be9-8f28-3c1faf6f2a22"

"Griffith, Nicola","Nicola Griffith","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Aud Torvingen is back-contemporary fiction's toughest, most emotionally complicated noir hero returns to teach a new round of lessons in hard-hitting justice, and to confront new adversaries: her own vulnerability and desire.      The steely shell of Nicola Griffith's seemingly indomitable protagonist Aud Torvingen appears to be cracking. The six-foot-tall fury (who proved in *The Blue Place* and *Stay* that she can kill you as easily as look at you) is shaken by the shocking consequences of the self-defense class she's been teaching, and her investigation of what seems to be run-of-the-mill real-estate fraud is turning out to be more than she bargained for.      *Always* brilliantly intertwines the dramatic episodes of Aud's class with the increasingly complicated investigation that introduces Aud to the limits of self-reliance, and to the scary and beautiful prospect of allowing oneself to depend on other people. What emerges is a thrilling, thoroughly engrossing novel that imbues Griffith's ""classic noir hero"" (*The New York Times Book Review*) with an emotional complexity that far exceeds the boundaries of the genre, and will push Griffith to her well-deserved place at the front rank of new-wave literary crime writers.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Nicola Griffith\Always (3341)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:49:42+02:00","epub","9781594489358","3341","isbn:9781594489358","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","Riverhead Hardcover","4","","1.0","437019","Fiction, Suspense, Fiction - Espionage, thriller, Mystery, Literary, English Mystery & Suspense Fiction, Torvingen; Aud (Fictitious character), Lesbians, Ex-police officers, Lesbian","Always","Always","13752d1e-fc7e-49b9-ba50-b04e8686c84f"

"Griffith, George Chetwynd","George Griffith","SUMMARY: George Griffith (1857-1906) was a prolific British science fiction writer and noted explorer who wrote during the late Victorian and Edwardian age. Many of his visionary tales appeared in magazines such as ""Pearson's Magazine"" and ""Pearson's Weekly"" before being published as novels. Griffith was extremely popular in the United Kingdom, though he failed to find similar acclaim in the United States, in part due to his revolutionary and socialist views. A journalist, rather than scientist by background, what his stories lack in scientific rigor and literary grace they make up for in sheer exuberance of execution. Although eternally overshadowed by H. G. Wells, Griffith's epic fantasies of romantic anarchists in a future world of war dominated by airship battlefleets and grandiose engineering provided a template for steampunk novels a century before the term was coined. The influence of books such as ""The Angel of the Revolution"" and the character of Olga Romanoff on British fantasy writer Michael Moorcock is striking. The concept of revolutionaries imposing ""a 'pax aeronautica' over the earth,"" at the center of Angel of the Revolution, was taken up by Wells many years later, in ""The Shape of Things to Come."" Though a less accomplished writer than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling or H.G. Wells, his novels were popular in their day and foreshadowed World War I and the Russian Revolutions and the concepts of the air to surface missile and VTOL aircraft. He wrote several tales of adventure set on contemporary earth, while ""The Outlaws of the Air"" depicted a future of aerial warfare and the creation of a Pacific island utopia. Sam Moskowitz described him as ""undeniably the most popular science fiction writer in England between 1893 and 1895."" EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Certain it should be that   beyond and about this World of Length   and Breadth   and Thickness   there is another World   or State of Existence   consisting of these and another dimension of which only those beings who are privileged to enter or dwell in it can have any conception.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\George Griffith\The Mummy and Miss Nitocris (3343)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:49:42+02:00","epub","9780554317946","3343","isbn:9780554317946","","Calibre Library","2008-08-15T01:00:00+02:00","BiblioLife","","","1.0","245400","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Adventure, Fantasy, Science Fiction - Adventure, General & Literary Fiction, Historical, Modern & contemporary fiction (post c 1945), Fantasy - Historical, Fiction : Fantasy - Historical","The Mummy and Miss Nitocris","Mummy and Miss Nitocris, The","4172d54a-31d9-4a72-85ab-eedc569e8329"

"Greene, Robert","Robert Greene","*The eagerly anticipated new book from the author of the bestselling ** * *The 48 Laws of Power**** *  
**
 * *What did Charles Darwin, middling schoolboy and underachieving second son, do to become one of the earliest and greatest naturalists the world has known? What were the similar choices made by Mozart and by Caesar Rodriguez, the U.S. Air Force’s last ace fighter pilot? In *Mastery* , Robert Greene’s fifth book, he mines the biographies of great historical figures for clues about gaining control over our own lives and destinies. Picking up where *The 48 Laws of Power* left off, Greene culls years of research and original interviews to blend historical anecdote and psychological insight, distilling the universal ingredients of the world’s masters.  
**
 * *Temple Grandin, Martha Graham, Henry Ford, Buckminster Fuller—all have lessons to offer about how the love for doing one thing exceptionally well can lead to mastery. Yet the secret, Greene maintains, is already in our heads. Debunking long-held cultural myths, he demonstrates just how we, as humans, are hardwired for achievement and supremacy. Fans of Greene’s earlier work and Malcolm Gladwell’s *Outliers* will eagerly devour this canny and erudite explanation of just what it takes to be great.   
**
### **About the Author**
 * *Robert Greene has a degree in classical studies and is the author of four previous, bestselling books, including *The 48 Laws of Power* and *The 50th Law*.

"Goscinny & Sempé","Goscinny & Sempé","Voici quatre-vingts histoires du Petit Nicolas qui n’avaient jamais été publiées en livre. Ces nouvelles aventures prolongent la saga du célèbre écolier, chef-d’oeuvre de notre littérature imaginé par deux humoristes de génie : Goscinny et Sempé. 
« – Chez nous, pour le réveillon, je lui ai dit, il y aura mémé, ma tante Dorothée, et tonton Eugène.
– Chez nous, m’a dit Alceste, il y aura du boudin blanc, et de la dinde. »
–« – Les châteaux de cartes, c’est comme quand on boude: c’est amusant au début seulement. »
–« – J’avais été un peu retenu en classe par la maîtresse, qui me disait que je m’étais trompé dans un devoir d’arithmétique; il faudra que je dise à papa de faire attention. »

"Godin, Seth","Seth Godin","A tribe is any group of people, large or small, who are connected to one another, a leader, and an idea. For millions of years, humans have been seeking out tribes, be they religious, ethnic, economic, political, or even musical (think of the Deadheads). Its our nature. Now the Internet has eliminated the barriers of geography, cost, and time. All those blogs and social networking sites are helping existing tribes get bigger. But more important, theyre enabling countless new tribes to be borngroups of ten or ten thousand or ten million who care about their iPhones, or a political campaign, or a new way to fight global warming. And so the key question: Who is going to lead us? The Web can do amazing things, but it cant provide leadership. That still has to come from individuals people just like you who have passion about something. The explosion in tribes means that anyone who wants to make a difference now has the tools at her fingertips. If you think leadership is for other people, think againleaders come in surprising packages. Consider Joel Spolsky and his international tribe of scary-smart software engineers. Or Gary Vaynerhuck, a wine expert with a devoted following of enthusiasts. Chris Sharma leads a tribe of rock climbers up impossible cliff faces, while Mich Mathews, a VP at Microsoft, runs her internal tribe of marketers from her cube in Seattle. All they have in common is the desire to change things, the ability to connect a tribe, and the willingness to lead. If you ignore this opportunity, you risk turning into a sheepwalkersomeone who fights to protect the status quo at all costs, never asking if obedience is doing you (or your organization) any good. Sheepwalkers dont do very well these days. Tribes will make you think (really think) about the opportunities in leading your fellow employees, customers, investors, believers, hobbyists, or readers. . . . Its not easy, but its easier than you think.

"Gilman, Felix","Felix Gilman","SUMMARY: In this breathtaking debut novel, one man embarks on a thrilling and treacherous quest for his people’s lost god—in a labyrinthine Dickensian city that is either blessed . . . or haunted. Arjun arrives in Ararat just as a magnificent winged creature sails over the city. It is the day of the return of that long-awaited mystical creature: the great Bird. As it soars across the land, as the city’s mapless streets are transformed, as the great river changes its course, as the territories of the city’s avian life are redrawn, crowds cheer and guns salute. Then comes the time for the Bird’s power to be trapped—within the hull of the floating warship Thunderer, now a living temple to the Bird, and a terrible new weapon to be used, allegedly, in the interests of all of Ararat. Hurtled into this convulsing world is Arjun, who will unwittingly unleash a dark power beyond his imagining—and dare to test Ararat’s moving boundaries. For in this city of gods, he has come to search among them, not to hide.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Felix Gilman\Thunderer (3409)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:49:56+02:00","epub","9780553591101","3409","isbn:9780553591101","","Calibre Library","2008-09-30T01:00:00+02:00","Spectra","4","","1.0","768174","General, Fiction, Fantasy, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Epic, Fiction - Fantasy, Fantasy - Epic","Thunderer","Thunderer","d4cbd7d1-0512-4847-8a37-ac35392b47df"
"Gibson, William Carleton","William Gibson","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  In the Matrix of cyberspace, angels and voodoo zaibatsus fight it out for world domination and computer cowboys like Turner and Count Zero risk their minds for fat crumbs.  Turner woke up in a new body with a beautiful woman beside him. They let him recuperate for a while in Mexico, then Hosaka reactivated his memory for a mission more dangerous than the one that nearly killed him.  The head designer from Maas-Biolabs is defecting to Hosaka, or so he says. Turner has to deliver him safely, and the biochips he invented -- which are of supreme interest to other parties, some of whom are not human.  Count Zero is human. Indeed, he's just a kid from Barrytown, and totally unprepared for the heavy duty data coming his way when he's caught up in the cyberspace war triggered by the defection. With voodoo on the Net and angels in the software, he can only hope that the megacorps and the superrich have their virtual hands full already.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\William Gibson\Count Zero (3410)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:49:56+02:00","epub","9780006480426","3410","isbn:9780006480426","","Calibre Library","2010-02-01T02:00:00+02:00","Harpercollins Pub Ltd","4","","1.0","291938","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fantasy, 20th century, American fiction","Count Zero","Count Zero","81d183c5-23dc-447c-a559-3be2e9b491bf"
"Gibson, William Carleton","William Gibson","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  The last of the Sprawl trilogy: the AIs of Neuromancer have suffered a traumatized, cataclysmic coming to self-awareness and now haunt cyberspace as voodoo powers.  Mona's pimp sells her to a plastic surgeon in New York and she's turned overnight into someone else. The pimp winds up dead. Mona weeps for him. She's a sweet, dumb girl! so far.  Angie the famous Hollywood stim star has started remembering things. Despite the efforts of studio bosses to keep her in ignorance, Angie will discover who she really is! and why she doesn't need to jack into the Matrix in order to enter cyberspace.  In the depths of the rustbelt, the ring of steel garbage and toxic waste surrounding the Sprawl, Gentry obsessively seeks the darkest secrets of the Matrix. Seeking rapture.  When an impossibly tall and powerful skyscraper of data appears suddenly in the landscape of the Matrix, Gentry is ready for it, Angie is part of it, and Mona is set for overdrive. Rapture is on the agenda for all three, but others greedy for money and power will fight them to the death.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\William Gibson\Mona Lisa Overdrive (3411)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:49:57+02:00","epub","9780006480440","3411","isbn:9780006480440","","Calibre Library","2010-02-01T02:00:00+02:00","Harpercollins Pub Ltd","4","","1.0","228399","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fantasy, 20th century, American fiction","Mona Lisa Overdrive","Mona Lisa Overdrive","2f12dd20-173c-490d-8521-7e84c4e2a92a"

Welcome to NoCal and SoCal, the uneasy sister-states of what used to be California. Here the millennium has come and gone, leaving in its wake only stunned survivors. In Los Angeles, Berry Rydell is a former armed-response rentacop now working for a bounty hunter. Chevette Washington is a bicycle messenger turned pick-pocket who impulsively snatches a pair of innocent-looking sunglasses. But these are no ordinary shades. What you can see through these high-tech specs can make you rich--or get you killed. Now Berry and Chevette are on the run, zeroing in on the digitalized heart of DatAmerica, where pure information is the greatest high. And a mind can be a terrible thing to crash.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\William Gibson\Virtual Light (3412)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:49:57+02:00","epub","9780140157727","3412","isbn:9780140157727","","Calibre Library","2010-02-01T02:00:00+02:00","Gardners Books","4","","1.0","277069","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, General & Literary Fiction, Fiction - General","Virtual Light","Virtual Light","d828d485-898a-4b7b-bbac-daf2a263ad7e"
"Gibson, William Carleton","William Gibson & Jack Womack (Afterword)","SUMMARY: Here is the novel that started it all, launching the cyberpunk generation, and the first novel to win the holy trinity of science fiction: the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award and the Philip K. Dick Award. With Neuromancer, William Gibson introduced the world to cyberspace--and science fiction has never been the same. Case was the hottest computer cowboy cruising the information superhighway--jacking his consciousness into cyberspace, soaring through tactile lattices of data and logic, rustling encoded secrets for anyone with the money to buy his skills. Then he double-crossed the wrong people, who caught up with him in a big way--and burned the talent out of his brain, micron by micron. Banished from cyberspace, trapped in the meat of his physical body, Case courted death in the high-tech underworld. Until a shadowy conspiracy offered him a second chance--and a cure--for a price....","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\William Gibson\Neuromancer (3413)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:49:57+02:00","epub","9780441012039","3413","isbn:9780441012039","","Calibre Library","2010-02-01T02:00:00+02:00","Ace Books","4","","1.0","394499","Science fiction, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, High Tech, Science Fiction - High Tech, Information superhighway, Computer hackers, Business intelligence, Nervous system","Neuromancer","Neuromancer","5de742bb-aa9b-4faf-aaf1-9617af45c8fc"
"Ghosh, Amitav","Amitav Ghosh","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  It begins in a near future New York City, when Antar, a low-level programmer and data analyst for a large bureaucratic concern, comes upon the lost and battered I.D. card of a man he once knew--a man who vanished without a trace some where in the teeming excess of Calcutta, India, several years before. Strangely compelled, Antar initiates a search into the facts behind the disappearance of the enigmatic L. Murugan, and is unwittingly drawn into a bizarre alternate history of medical science.   Leaping backward in time, we join Murugan in Calcutta in 1995, as he follows the twisted threads of science, counter-science and ritual back a hundred years further to the laboratory of Ronald Ross, the British scientist who discovered how malaria is transmitted to humans. Obsessed with the weird, fortuitous coincidences that led to Ross' groundbreaking discovery, Murugan has stumbled upon evidence of an impossible ongoing experiment in controlled destiny, protected by a powerful unseen society that moves the world in secret and in silence.   Suddenly, every fact hitherto known can no longer be trusted, for everything has been revealed to be other than it appears. In this steamy, overcrowded city of clashing cultures and hidden faces, L. Murugan has opened a Pandora's Box that carefully orchestrated death and misdirection have long kept shut. And the truth that is revealed will have momentous con sequences--for Murugan, for Antar, for a troubled female journalist and an exquisite Indian celebrity...for everyone and everything human.

"Gernsback, Hugo","Hugo Gernsback","SUMMARY: By the year 2660, science has transformed and conquered the world, rescuing humanity from itself. Spectacular inventions from the farthest reaches of space and deep beneath the earth are available to meet every need, providing antidotes to individual troubles and social ills. Inventors are highly prized and respected, and they are jealously protected and lavishly cared for by world governments. That support and acclaim, however—as the most brilliant of scientists, Ralph 124C 41+, discovers—is not without its price. This visionary novel of the twenty-seventh century was written by Hugo Gernsback (1887–1964), founder of the influential magazine Amazing Stories. Marvelously prophetic and creative, Ralph 124C 41+ celebrates technological advances and entrances readers with an exuberant, unforgettable vision of what our world might become. This commemorative edition makes this landmark tale widely available for the first time in decades and features the prized Frank R. Paul illustrations from the rare first edition, a list of inventions and technological devices, and Hugo Gernsback's prefaces to the first and second editions.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Hugo Gernsback\Ralph 124C 41__ a romance of the ye (3415)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:49:58+02:00","epub","9780803270985","3415","isbn:9780803270985","","Calibre Library","2000-01-01T02:00:00+02:00","Lincoln : University of Nebraska Press, 2000.","4","","1.0","137288","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, 20th Century American Novel And Short Story, Modern fiction","Ralph 124C 41+: a romance of the year 2660","Ralph 124C 41+: a romance of the year 2660","ac16f127-1fac-410e-afb4-f7ff463c1c6e"

"Neil, Gaiman,","Gaiman, Neil","Richard Mayhew is an unassuming young businessman living in London, with a dull job and a pretty but demanding fiancee. Then one night he stumbles across a girl bleeding on the sidewalk. He stops to help her--and the life he knows vanishes like smoke. Several hours later, the girl is gone too. And by the following morning Richard Mayhew has been erased from his world. His bank cards no longer work, taxi drivers won't stop for him, his hundred rents his apartment out to strangers. He has become invisible, and inexplicably consigned to a London of shadows and darkness a city of monsters and saints, murderers and angels, that exists entirely in a subterranean labyrinth of sewer canals andabandoned subway stations. He has fallen through the cracks of reality and has landed somewhere different, somewhere that is Neverwhere. For this is the home of Door, the mysterious girl whom Richard rescued in the London Above. A personage of great power and nobility in this murky, candlelit realm, she is on a mission to discover the cause of her family's slaughter, and in doing so preserve this strange underworld kingdom from the malevolence that means to destroy it. And with nowhere else to turn, Richard Mayhew must now join the Lady Door's entourage in their determined--and possibly fatal--quest. For the dread journey ever-downward--through bizarre anachronisms and dangerous incongruities, and into dusty corners of stalled time--is Richard's final hope, his last road back to a ""real"" world that is growing disturbingly less real by the minute. If Tim Burton reimagined The Phantom of the Opera, if Jack Finney let his dark side take over, if you rolled the best work of Clive Barker, Peter Straub and Caleb Carr into one, you still would have something that fell far short of Neil Gaiman's NEVERWHERE. It is a masterful debut novel of darkly hypnotic power, and one of the most absorbing reads to come along in years.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Gaiman, Neil\Neverwhere (3478)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:50:10+02:00","epub","0060557818","3478","isbn:0060557818","","Calibre Library","2010-06-14T06:00:00+02:00","William Morrow","","","1.0","273325","","Neverwhere","Neverwhere","1bda6594-9546-4699-8fb8-a0087184629c"

A weapon that may already be in the hands of our enemies.     *  Months before publication, *One Second After* has already been cited on the floor of Congress as a book all Americans should read, a book already being discussed in the corridors of the Pentagon as a truly realistic look at a weapon and its awesome power to destroy the entire United States, literally within one second.

Diego, a seventeen-year-old illegal Mexican immigrant, owes his salvation to master grifter Thomas Schell. Together with Schell's gruff and powerful partner, they sail comfortably through hard times, scamming New York's grieving rich with elaborate, ingeniously staged séances -- until an impossible occurrence changes everything. While ""communing with spirits,"" Schell sees an image of a young girl in a pane of glass, silently entreating the con man for help. Though well aware that his otherworldly ""powers"" are a sham, Schell inexplicably offers his services to help find the lost child -- drawing Diego along with him into a tangled maze of deadly secrets and terrible experimentation. At once a hypnotically compelling mystery and a stunningly evocative portrait of Depression-era New York, The Girl in the Glass is a masterly literary adventure from a writer of exemplary vision and skill.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Jeffery Ford\The girl in the glass (3503)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:50:18+02:00","epub","9780060936198","3503","isbn:9780060936198","","Calibre Library","2005-08-04T01:00:00+02:00","New York : Dark Alley, c2005.","4","","1.0","226872","Fiction, Suspense fiction, Historical fiction, Historical, Swindlers and swindling, Literary, Historical - General, American Historical Fiction, Depressions, Spiritualists, Seances, Mediums, Fiction - Historical","The girl in the glass","girl in the glass, The","ae2d6a03-32a5-449d-9db2-5a85060e99a3"

"Ford, Jeffrey","Jeffrey Ford","SUMMARY: In New York's Long Island, in the unpredictable decade of the 1960s, a young boy laments the approaching close of summer and the advent of sixth grade. Growing up in a household with an overworked father whom he rarely sees, an alcoholic mother who paints wonderful canvases that are never displayed, an older brother who serves as both tormentor and protector, and a younger sister who inhabits her own secret world, the boy takes his amusements where he can find them. Some of his free time is spent in the basement of the family's modest home, where he and his brother, Jim, have created Botch Town, a detailed cardboard replica of their community, complete with clay figurines representing friends and neighbors. And so the time passes with a not-always-reassuring sameness—until the night a prowler is reported stalking the neighborhood.   Appointing themselves ad hoc investigators, the brothers set out to aid the police—while their little sister, Mary, smokes cigarettes, speaks in other voices, inhabits alternate personas . . . and, unbeknownst to her older siblings, moves around the inanimate residents of Botch Town. But ensuing events add a shadowy cast to the boys' night games: disappearances, deaths, and spectral sightings capped off by the arrival of a sinister man in a long white car trawling the neighborhood after dark. Strangest of all is the inescapable fact that every one of these troubling occurrences seems to correspond directly to the changes little Mary has made to the miniature town in the basement.   Not since Ray Bradbury's classic Dandelion Wine has a novel so richly evoked the dark magic of small-town boyhood. At once a hypnotically compelling mystery, a masterful re-creation of a unique time and place, a celebration of youth, and a poignant and disquieting portrait of home and family—all balancing on a razor's edge separating reality from the unsettlingly remarkable—The Shadow Year is a monumental new work from one of contemporary fiction's most fearless and inventive artists.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Jeffrey Ford\The shadow year (3505)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:50:18+02:00","epub","9780061231520","3505","isbn:9780061231520","","Calibre Library","2008-03-11T02:00:00+02:00","New York : William Morrow, c2008.","4","","1.0","219453","General, Fiction, Fiction - General, Domestic fiction, Literary, American Historical Fiction, Urban Life, Teenage boys, Cities and towns, Family Life","The shadow year","shadow year, The","e9b161f8-40c2-4f39-9a85-b74257fb4b0f"

"Foer, Joshua","Joshua Foer","### Amazon.com Review
 *Moonwalking with Einstein* follows Joshua Foer's compelling journey as a participant in the U.S. Memory Championship. As a science journalist covering the competition, Foer became captivated by the secrets of the competitors, like how the current world memory champion, Ben Pridmore, could memorize the exact order of 1,528 digits in an hour. He met with individuals whose memories are truly unique—from one man whose memory only extends back to his most recent thought, to another who can memorize complex mathematical formulas without knowing any math. Brains remember visual imagery but have a harder time with other information, like lists, and so with the help of experts, Foer learned how to transform the kinds of memories he forgot into the kind his brain remembered naturally. The techniques he mastered made it easier to remember information, and Foer's story demonstrates that the tricks of the masters are accessible to anyone.   
*\--Miriam Landis*
**Author Q &A with Joshua Foer**
 **Q:** First, can you explain the title of you book, *Moonwalking with Einstein*?
 **A:** The title refers to a memory device I used in the US Memory Championship—specifically it's a mnemonic that helped me memorize a deck of playing cards. Moonwalking with Einstein works as a mnemonic because it's such a goofy image. Things that are weird or colorful are the most memorable. If you try to picture Albert Einstein sliding backwards across a dance floor wearing penny loafers and a diamond glove, that's pretty much unforgettable.
 **Q:** What are the U.S. Memory Championships? How did you become involved?
 **A:** The U.S. Memory Championship is a rather bizarre contest held each spring in New York City, in which people get together to see who can remember the most names of strangers, the most lines of poetry, the most random digits. I went to the event as a science journalist, to cover what I assumed would be the Super Bowl of savants. But when I talked to the competitors, they told me something really interesting. They weren't savants. And they didn't have photographic memories. Rather, they'd trained their memories using ancient techniques. They said anyone could do it. I was skeptical. Frankly, I didn't believe them. I said, well, if anyone can do it, could you teach me? A guy named Ed Cooke, who has one of the best trained memories in the world, took me under his wing and taught me everything he knew about memory techniques. A year later I came back to the contest, this time to try and compete, as a sort of exercise in participatory journalism. I was curious simply to see how well I'd do, but I ended up winning the contest. That really wasn't supposed to happen.
 **Q:** What was the most surprising thing you found out about yourself competing in the Memory Championships?
 **A:** In the process of studying these techniques, I learned something remarkable: that there's far more potential in our minds than we often give them credit for. I'm not just talking about the fact that it's possible to memorize lots of information using memory techniques. I'm talking about a lesson that is more general, and in a way much bigger: that it's possible, with training and hard work, to teach oneself to do something that might seem really difficult.
 **Q:** Can you explain the ""OK Plateau?""
 **A:** The OK Plateau is that place we all get to where we just stop getting better at something. Take typing, for example. You might type and type and type all day long, but once you reach a certain level, you just never get appreciably faster at it. That's because it's become automatic. You've moved it to the back of your mind's filing cabinet. If you want to become a faster typer, it's possible, of course. But you've got to bring the task back under your conscious control. You've got to push yourself past where you're comfortable. You have to watch yourself fail and learn from your mistakes. That's the way to get better at anything. And it's how I improved my memory.
 **Q:** What do you mean by saying there an ""art"" to memory?
 **A:** The ""art of memory"" refers to a set of techniques that were invented in ancient Greece. These are the same techniques that Cicero used to memorize his speeches, and that medieval scholars used to memorize entire books. The ""art"" is in creating imagery in your mind that is so unusual, so colorful, so unlike anything you've ever seen before that it's unlikely to be forgotten. That's why mnemonists like to say that their skills are as much about creativity as memory.
 **Q:e to say that their skills are as much about creativity as memory.**
 **Q:** How do you think technology has affected how and what we remember?
 **A:** Once upon a time people invested in their memories, they cultivated them. They studiously furnished their minds. They remembered. Today, of course, we've got books, and computers and smart phones to hold our memories for us. We've outsourced our memories to external devices. The result is that we no longer trust our memories. We see every small forgotten thing as evidence that they're failing us altogether. We've forgotten how to remember.
 **Q:** What is the connection between memory and our sense of time?
 **A:** As we get older, life seems to fly by faster and faster. That's because we structure our experience of time around memories. We remember events in relation to other events. But as we get older, and our experiences become less unique, our memories can blend together. If yesterday's lunch is indistinguishable from the one you ate the day before, it'll end up being forgotten. That's why it's so hard to remember meals. In the same way, if you're not doing things that are unique and different and memorable, this year can come to resemble the last, and end up being just as forgettable as yesterday's lunch. That's why it's so important to pack your life with interesting experiences that make your life memorable, and provide a texture to the passage of time.
 **Q:** How is your memory now?
 **A:** Ironically, not much better than when I started this whole journey. The techniques I learned, and used in the memory contest, are great for remembering structured information like shopping lists or phone numbers, but they don't improve any sort of underlying, generalizable memory ability. Unfortunately, I still misplace my car keys.

memories, such as the extensive training British cabbies must undergo. He also discusses ways we can train ourselves to have better memories, like the PAO system, in which, for example, every card in a deck is associated with an image of a specific person, action, or object. An engaging, informative, and for the forgetful, encouraging book. --David Pitt

"Finn, Mark","Mark Finn","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  The stranger at the side of the road doesn’t know much  about himself, but he knows he is definitely not Elvis. That aside,  the baby driving the car has his own set of problems. Now they’re  off to experience the southwest in the only vehicle that makes sense  for both of them: a carnation-pink 1963 Cadillac El Dorado...      MagicCon is an ordinary fantasy/science fiction convention. Three days  of comic books, anime, and X-Files jokes, which is exactly what Larry  and his friends are looking for. Unfortunately for Larry, a  long-forgotten Roman god named Stercutus is primed to make a comeback,  and this particular god’s sphere of influence really stinks...      Set in and around the fictional city of San Cibola, *Gods New and Used*  is a stand-alone companion piece to Clockwork Storybook, an online  shared world anthology of urban fantasy.  Mark Finn’s contributions  are often larger than life; they can be both sublime and ridiculous,  both wise and painfully dumb. Like the gods he portrays, Finn’s  writing style ranges from heroic to slap-happy, weaving together broad  comedy and genuine emotion into something that is nothing less than  true to life.      The stories in this collection showcase what Finn does best:  corralling the supernatural and the archetypal, and bringing them down  to earth, to sit next to you in the passenger seat as you cruise along  a highway somewhere in the California desert. Here you will meet the  embodiments of love, of thunder, and of rock and roll, and discover  about them what is frequently overlooked: that the gods are often more  human than we are.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Mark Finn\Gods New and Used (3528)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:50:28+02:00","epub","9780970484116","3528","isbn:9780970484116","","Calibre Library","2001-03-15T02:00:00+02:00","Clockwork Storybook","","","1.0","298466","General, Fiction, Fantasy, Fantasy - General, Fantasy fiction, Fiction - Fantasy","Gods New and Used","Gods New and Used","669fbe2c-60ab-49e6-b92e-b7e769403118"

WHAT IF YOU COULD BECOME WORLD-CLASS IN ANYTHING IN 6 MONTHS OR LESS? 
*The 4-Hour Chef* isn’t just a cookbook. It’s a choose-your-own-adventure guide to the world of rapid learning. 
# 1 *New York Times* bestselling author (and lifelong non-cook) Tim Ferriss takes you from Manhattan to Okinawa, and from Silicon Valley to Calcutta, unearthing the secrets of the world’s fastest learners and greatest chefs. Ferriss uses cooking to explain “meta-learning,” a step-by-step process that can be used to master anything, whether searing steak or shooting 3-pointers in basketball. That is the real “recipe” of *The 4-Hour Chef.*
You'll train *inside* the kitchen for everything outside the kitchen. Featuring tips and tricks from chess prodigies, world-renowned chefs, pro athletes, master sommeliers, super models, and everyone in between, this “cookbook for people who don’t buy cookbooks” is a guide to mastering cooking and life. 
*The 4-Hour Chef* is a five-stop journey through the art and science of learning: 
  1. META-LEARNING. Before you learn to cook, you must learn to learn. META charts the path to doubling your learning potential. 
  2. THE DOMESTIC. DOM is where you learn the building blocks of cooking. These are the ABCs (techniques) that can take you from Dr, Seuss to Shakespeare. 
  3. THE WILD. Becoming a master student requires self-sufficiency in all things. WILD teaches you to hunt, forage, and survive. 
  4. THE SCIENTIST. SCI is the mad scientist and modernist painter wrapped into one. This is where you rediscover whimsy and wonder. 
  5. THE PROFESSIONAL. Swaraj, a term usually associated with Mahatma Gandhi, can be translated as “self-rule.” In PRO, we’ll look at how the best in the world become the best in the world, and how you can chart your own path far beyond this book.

This edition contains an Introduction written for the 1974 edition and updated for the 1983 edition.     This collection was among Ellison's first and it shows a writer with a wide-ranging imagination, ferocious creative energy, devastating wit and an eye for the wonderful and terrifying and tragic.     Among the gems are ""All The Sounds of Fear"", ""The Sky is Burning"", ""The Very Last Day of a Good Woman"" and ""In Lonely Lands"".

"Ellis, Bret Easton","Bret Easton Ellis","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  'One of the most disturbing novels I've read in a long time. It possesses an unnerving air of documentary reality' - Michiko Kakutani, ""New York Times"". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with his debut novel, ""Less Than Zero"". Published when he was just twenty-one, this extraordinary and instantly infamous work has done more than simply define a genre, it has become a rare thing: a cult classic and a timeless embodiment of the zeitgeist. Twenty-five years on, ""Less Than Zero"" continues to be a landmark in the lives of successive generations of readers across the globe. Filled with relentless drinking in seamy bars and glamorous nightclubs, wild, drug-fuelled parties, and dispassionate sexual encounters, ""Less Than Zero"" - narrated by Clay, an eighteen-year-old student returning home to Los Angeles for Christmas - is a fierce coming-of-age story, justifiably celebrated for its unflinching depiction of hedonistic youth, its brutal portrayal of the inexorable consequences of such moral depravity, and its author's refusal to condone or chastise such behaviour. 'An extraordinarily accomplished first novel' - ""New Yorker"".  'The Catcher in the Rye for the MTV generation' - ""USA Today"". 'Remarkable. A killer - sexy, sassy, sad' - ""Village Voice"".","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Bret Easton Ellis\Less Than Zero (3568)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:50:44+02:00","epub","9780330519045","3568","isbn:9780330519045","eng","Calibre Library","2010-08-15T07:00:00+02:00","Pan Macmillan","","","1.0","132710","General, Fiction, Media Tie-In, Modern & contemporary fiction (post c 1945), General & Literary Fiction, Psychology, Psychopathology, Addiction","Less Than Zero","Less Than Zero","bb4afbed-a8b8-4b37-85ae-a6154bdd1394"
"Ellis, Bret Easton","Bret Easton Ellis","<h3>From Library Journal</h3> <p>This review is based on the galley issued by Ellis's original publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, before it cancelled the book. The book is now going through the editing process at Vintage. There may be some changes in the final version. The indignant attacks on Ellis's third novel (see News, p. 17; Editorial, p. 6) will make it difficult for most readers to judge it objectively. Although the book contains horrifying scenes, they must be read in the context of the book as a whole; the horror does not lie in the novel itself, but in the society it reflects. In the first third of the book, Pat Bateman, a 26-year-old who works on Wall Street, describes his designer lifestyle in excruciating detail. This is a world in which the elegance of a business card evokes more emotional response than the murder of a child. Then suddenly, for no apparent reason, Bateman calmly and deliberately blinds and stabs a homeless man. From here, the body count builds, as he kills a male acquaintance and sadistically tortures and murders two prostitutes, an old girlfriend, and a child he passes in the zoo. The recital of the brutalization is made even more horrible by the first-person narrator's delivery: flat, matter-of-fact, as impersonal as a car parts catalog. The author has carefully constructed the work so that the reader has no way to understand this killer's motivations, making it even more frightening. If these acts cannot be explained, there is no hope of protection from such random, senseless crimes. This book is not pleasure reading, but neither is it pornography. It is a serious novel that comments on a society that has become inured to suffering. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 9/15/90 and 12/90.<br /> <em>- Nora Rawlinson, ""Library Journal""</em><br /> Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc. </p> <h3>Review</h3> <p>“Bret Easton Ellis is a very, very good writer [and] <strong>American Psycho</strong> is a beautifully controlled, careful, important novel…. The novelist’s function is to keep a running tag on the progress of culture; and he’s done it brilliantly…. A seminal book.” —Fay Weldon, <em>The Washington Post</em> </p> <p>“A masterful satire and a ferocious, hilarious, ambitious, inspiring piece of writing, which has large elements of Jane Austen at her vitriolic best. An important book.” —Katherine Dunn </p> <p>“A great novel. What Emerson said about genius, that it’s the return of one’s rejected thoughts with an alienated majesty, holds true for <strong>American Psycho</strong>…. There is a fever to the life of this book that is, in my reading, unknown in American literature.” —Michael Tolkin </p> <p>“The first novel to come along in years that takes on deep and Dostoyevskian themes…. [Ellis] is showing older authors where the hands come to on the clock.” —Norman Mailer, <em>Vanity Fair</em> </p>","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Bret Easton Ellis\American psycho_ a novel (3569)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:50:44+02:00","epub","9780679735779","3569","isbn:9780679735779","eng","Calibre Library","1991-11-15T19:44:19+02:00","Random House, Inc.","","","1.0","503584","Horror, Fiction, General, Psychological fiction, Crimes against, Psychological, Manhattan (New York, N.Y.), Women, Horror tales, Serial Murderers, Wall Street (New York, Psychopaths, Rapists, Wall Street, Women - Crimes against","American psycho: a novel","American psycho: a novel","aee587cd-5169-40df-b851-f1caaa070c54"

"Unknown","Carol Dweck","World-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck, in decades of research on achievement and success, has discovered a truly groundbreaking idea--the power of our mindset.  
  
Dweck explains why it's not just our abilities and talent that bring us success--but whether we approach them with a fixed or growth mindset. She makes clear why praising intelligence and ability doesn't foster self-esteem and lead to accomplishment, but may actually jeopardize success. With the right mindset, we can motivate our kids and help them to raise their grades, as well as reach our own goals--personal and professional. Dweck reveals what all great parents, teachers, CEOs, and athletes already know: how a simple idea about the brain can create a love of learning and a resilience that is the basis of great accomplishment in every area.

"Dozois, Gardner R.","edited by Gardner Dozois","SUMMARY: The twenty-first century has so far proven to be exciting and wondrous and filled with challenges we had never dreamed. New possibilities previously unimagined appear almost daily . . . and science fiction stories continue to explore those possibilities with delightful results:Collected in this anthology are such compelling stories as:""On K2 with Kanakaredes"" by Dan Simmons. A relentlessly paced and absorbing tale set in the near future about three mountain climbers who must scale the face of K2 with some very odd company. ""The Human Front"" by Ken MacLeod. In this compassionate coming-of-age tale the details of life are just a bit off from things as we know them-and nothing is as it appears to be.""Glacial"" by Alastair Reynolds. A fascinating discovery on a distant planet leads to mass death and a wrenching mystery as spellbinding as anything in recent short fiction. The twenty-six stories in this collection imaginatively takes us far across the universe, into the very core of our beings, to the realm of the gods, and the moment just after now. Included here are the works of masters of the form and of bright new talents, including:Eleanor ArnasonChris BeckettMichael BlumleinMichael CassuttBrenda W.

"Dozois, Gardner R.","edited by Gardner Dozois","SUMMARY: Once the mainstay of science fiction, adventure stories fell out of favor during the 1960s and early 1970s. But in recent years, science fiction writers have spun out galaxy-spanning adventures as imaginative and wonderful as any of yesteryear's tales. Renowned editor Gardner Dozois assembles seventeen such escapades here, with stories from today's and tomorrow's finest writers, including: Stephen Baxter, Tony Daniel, R. Garcia y Robertson, Peter F. Hamilton, Janet Kagan, George R. R. Martin, Paul J. McAuley, Maureen F. McHugh. G. David Nordley, Robert Reed, Mary Rosenblum, Bruce Sterling, Michael Swanwick, George Turner, John Varley, Vernor Vinge, Walter Jon Williams These stories brim with the exciting thrills our universe offers us-- alien landscapes, unimagined realms, life unlike any we have known before, and that mysterious realm known as the human soul.

Here now, on the brink of the twenty-first century, the future remains as distant and as unknowable as ever . . . and science fiction stories continue to explore it with delightful results:Collected in this anthology are such imaginative gems as:""The Wedding Album"" by David Marusek. In a high-tech future, the line between reality and simulation has grown thin . . . and it's often hard to tell who's on what side.""Everywhere"" by Geoff Ryman. Do the people who live in utopian conditions ever recognize them as such?""Hatching the Phoenix"" by Frederik Pohl. One of science fiction's Grand Masters returns with a star-crossing tale of the Heechee---the enigmatic, vanished aliens whose discarded technology guides mankind through the future.""A Hero of the Empire"" by Robert Silverberg. Showing that the past is as much a province of the imagination as the future, this novelette returns to an alternate history when the Roman Empire never fell to show us just how the course of history can be altered.The twenty-seven stories in this collection imaginatively take us to nearby planets and distant futures, into the past and into universes no larger than a grain of sand. Included here are the works of masters of the form and of bright new talents.Supplementing the stories are the editor's insightful summation of the year's events and a lengthy list of honorable mentions, making this book a valuable resource in addition to serving as the single best place in the universe to find stories that stir the imagination and the heart.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\edited by Gardner Dozois\The year's best science fiction_ se (3614)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:50:52+02:00","epub","9780312264178","3614","isbn:9780312264178","","Calibre Library","2000-03-14T21:30:00+02:00","New York : St. Martin's Press, 2000.","4","","1.0","868426","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Science fiction; American, Anthologies, Short Stories, Anthologies (multiple authors), Anthologies (non-poetry), Science Fiction - Anthologies, Fiction anthologies & collections","The year's best science fiction: seventeenth annual collection","year's best science fiction: seventeenth annual collection, The","12044011-144a-465d-bcaa-b52261d8c035"

"Dozois, Gardner R.","edited by Gardner Dozois","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Long regarded as the premier annual collection of science fiction stories, Gardner Dozois's latest volume of *The Year's Best Science Fiction* continues this tradition of excellence with twenty-five representing the finest offerings in the field.    Among the gems included here are:  ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang, in which the story of alien contact and a very human drama merge beautifully    ""The Island of the Immortals"" by Ursula K. Le Guin, in which a brave traveler investigates the reasons why people shun the exotic island    ""Approaching Perimelasma"" by Geoffrey A. Landis, which boldly takes us into a black hole and through the stunning changes that ensue    ""Taklamakan"" by Bruce Sterling, a wildly inventive tale of future spies in a Lost World    ""The Summer Isles"" by Ian R. MacLeod, a moving novella reflecting an alternate history in which the Great War turned out a bit differently    In addition, there are twenty more stories here by the field's masters and by up-and-coming new writers, including:   William Barton  Stephen Baxter  Rob Chilson  Tony Daniel  Cory Doctorow  Greg Egan  Jim Grimsley  Gwyneth Jones  Chris Lawson  Tanith Lee  Paul J. McAuley  Ian McDonald  Robert Reed  William Browning Spencer  Allen Steele  Michael Swanwick  Howard Waldrop  Cherry Wilder  Liz Williams  Robert Charles Wilson    Completing the collection are Dozois's insightful survey of the year in science fiction and a long list of Honorable Mentions.     With its explorations of outer space and inner space, with its examinations of what it means to be human today and tomorrow, and with its love of a good yarn, this volume remains the single best source for science fiction stories.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\edited by Gardner Dozois\The year's best science fiction_ si (3616)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:50:53+02:00","epub","9780312204457","3616","isbn:9780312204457","","Calibre Library","1999-12-15T21:30:00+02:00","New York : St. Martin's Press, 1999.","","","1.0","844793","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Science fiction; American, Anthologies, Short Stories, Science fiction; English, Anthologies (multiple authors), Anthologies (non-poetry), English, Science Fiction - Anthologies, Fiction anthologies & collections, c 1990 to c 2000, Yearbooks; annuals; almanacs","The year's best science fiction: sixteenth annual collection","year's best science fiction: sixteenth annual collection, The","b97f224f-54c6-4dd5-8b4b-e52172b05389"

Without warning, a once majestic world is reduced to near-rubble—and the very future of humankind is in dire jeopardy.   Interplanetary leaders are on the brink of abandoning Earth and its colonies to an overwhelming enemy. But Brigadier General Garroway of the Marine Interstellar Expeditionary Unit is unwilling to concede defeat—not as long as there's a single marine willing to give his or her life in defense of their embattled homeworld. The ultimate battle is about to be waged—with breathtaking new attack technology, an ancient code of courage, and the help of an ally race that once inhabited the Earth—in a war that will alter the universe forever . . .","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Ian Douglas\Star Marines_ Book Three of The Leg (3633)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:50:56+02:00","epub","9780380818266","3633","isbn:9780380818266","","Calibre Library","2007-01-10T21:30:00+02:00","Eos","4","","1.0","332140","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Adventure, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Life on other planets, Space warfare","Star Marines: Book Three of The Legacy Trilogy","Star Marines: Book Three of The Legacy Trilogy","d9e1708b-db6a-41e9-a5c1-72c13af0e616"

But a research mission to the planet Ishtar has made a terrifying -- and fatal -- discovery: the Ahanu, ancestors of the former masters, live on, far from the reach of Earth -- born weapons and technology ... and tens of thousands of captive human souls still bow to their iron will. Now Earth's Interstellar Marine Expeditionary Unit must undertake a rescue operation as improbable as it is essential to humankind's future, embarking on a ten-year voyage to a hostile world to face an entrenched enemy driven by dreams of past glory and intent once more on domination.

But Earth is twenty-one years older than the home planet they originally left, and the Marines need time to retrain and readjust -- time they do not have, due to the bizzare disappearance of a detachment of their brothers- and sisters-in-arms. It is a mystery, but there is a starting point: an ancient wormhole threading through the Sirius system. Whatever waits on the other side must be confronted, with stealth, with force, and without fear -- be it an ancient enemy or a devastating new threat.

"Doherty, Robert G.","Robert Doherty","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  They were the men called upon to do the impossible. A top-secret unit who were  tasked with what others would call suicide missions. They were the men who had  nothing to lose.    Captain Jim Vaughn is a soldier in disgrace. Commanding a special forces  mission to capture terrorists in the Philippines, Vaughn's team is destroyed,  and when the smoke clears, he is the one made the scapegoat. Forced into the  shadows by the scandal, Vaughn is offered a chance to redeem himself when he is  approached by an enigmatic government agent looking for a few desperate men.   Vaughn is recruited into a new team, but is shocked to meet his new  teammates, a group of men outside of the regular chain of command. These were  men who had used up all their second chances. These are men who have crossed the  line one too many times. Drug users. Felons. The insane. The terminally ill.  These are now the men that Vaughn must trust with his life.   This group of outcasts and misfits has been assembled for two reasons they  are skilled, and they are expendable. These are the kinds of men who are needed  to attempt missions the government can't acknowledge, the country can't condone,  and the team cannot fail. But the deeper Vaughn gets into the unique group, the  more he realizes that the organization may be concealing more than the rap  sheets of its most unusual operators. A team of such unique properties is the  perfect tool to use againt America's enemies...and possibly America itself.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Robert Doherty\Section 8 (3639)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:50:57+02:00","epub","9780060735838","3639","isbn:9780060735838","","Calibre Library","2005-09-07T21:30:00+02:00","HarperTorch","","","1.0","227345","Fiction, Action & Adventure, War & Military, Adventure fiction, Fiction - Men's Adventure, Men's Adventure, Espionage, Undercover operations - United States, Popular American Fiction, Undercover operations, Spy stories","Section 8","Section 8","5b041f81-4074-4881-945e-81705fed9714"

As the war with the Ramanthian continues, Captain Antonio Santana and his force of biobods and cyborgs find themselves surrounded by enemy forces, faced with annihilation at every turn.

"Dicker, Joël","Joël Dicker","À New York, au printemps 2008, alors que l’Amérique bruisse
des prémices de l’élection présidentielle, Marcus Goldman,
jeune écrivain à succès, est dans la tourmente : il est incapable
d’écrire le nouveau roman qu’il doit remettre à son éditeur d’ici
quelques mois.
Le délai est près d’expirer quand soudain tout bascule pour
lui : son ami et ancien professeur d’université, Harry Quebert,
l’un des écrivains les plus respectés du pays, est rattrapé par son
passé et se retrouve accusé d’avoir assassiné, en 1975, Nola
Kellergan, une jeune fille de 15 ans, avec qui il aurait eu une
liaison.
Convaincu de l’innocence de Harry, Marcus abandonne tout
pour se rendre dans le New Hampshire et mener son enquête.
Il est rapidement dépassé par les événements : l’enquête
s’enfonce et il fait l’objet de menaces. Pour innocenter Harry et
sauver sa carrière d’écrivain, il doit absolument répondre à trois
questions : Qui a tué Nola Kellergan ? Que s’est-il passé dans le
New Hampshire à l’été 1975 ? Et comment écrit-on un roman
à succès ?
Sous ses airs de thriller à l’américaine, La Vérité sur l’Affaire
Harry Quebert est une réflexion sur l’Amérique, sur les travers
de la société moderne, sur la littérature, sur la justice et sur les
médias.

"Dick, Philip K.","Philip K. Dick","SUMMARY: Nobody but Philip K. Dick could so successfully combine SF comedy with the unease of reality gone wrong, shifting underfoot like quicksand. Besides grisly ideas like funeral parlors where you swap gossip for the advice of the frozen dead, Ubik (1969) offers such deadpan farce as a moneyless character's attack on the robot apartment door that demands a five-cent toll: ""I'll sue you,"" the door said as the first screw fell out. Joe Chip said, ""I've never been sued by a door. But I guess I can live through it."" Chip works for Glen Runciter's anti-psi security agency, which hires out its talents to block telepathic snooping and paranormal dirty tricks. When its special team tackles a big job on the Moon, something goes terribly wrong. Runciter is killed, it seems--but messages from him now appear on toilet walls, traffic tickets, or product labels. Meanwhile, fragments of reality are timeslipping into past versions: Joe Chip's beloved stereo system reverts to a hand-cranked 78 player with bamboo needles. Why does Runciter's face appear on U.S. coins? Why the repeated ads for a hard-to-find universal panacea called Ubik (""safe when taken as directed"")? The true, chilling state of affairs slowly becomes clear, though the villain isn't who Joe Chip thinks. And this is Dick country, where final truths are never quite final and--with the help of Ubik--the reality/illusion balance can still be tilted the other way. --David Langford, Amazon.co.uk","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Philip K.

Dr. Eph Goodweather, head of their Canary project, a rapid-response team that investigates biological threats, gets the call and boards the plane. What he finds makes his blood run cold.  In a pawnshop in Spanish Harlem, a former professor and survivor of the Holocaust named Abraham Setrakian knows something is happening. And he knows the time has come, that a war is brewing . . .  So begins a battle of mammoth proportions as the vampiric virus that has infected New York begins to spill out into the streets.

"Toro, Guillermo Del & Hogan, Chuck","Guillermo del Toro & Chuck Hogan","### It’s been two years since the vampiric virus was unleashed in *The Strain* , and the entire world now lies on the brink of annihilation. There is only night as nuclear winter blankets the land, the sun filtering through the poisoned atmosphere for two hours each day—the perfect environment for the propagation of vampires.
There has been a mass extermination of humans, the best and the brightest, the wealthy and the influential, orchestrated by the Master—an ancient vampire possessed of unparalleled powers—who selects survivors based on compliance. Those humans who remain are entirely subjugated, interred in camps, and separated by status: those who breed more humans, and those who are bled for the sustenance of the Master’s vast army. 
The future of humankind lies in the hands of a ragtag band of freedom fighters—Dr. Eph Goodweather, former head of the Centers for Disease Control’s biological threats team; Dr. Nora Martinez, a fellow doctor with a talent for dispatching the undead; Vasiliy Fet, the colorful Russian exterminator; and Mr. Quinlan, the half-breed offspring of the Master who is bent on revenge. It’s their job to rescue Eph’s son, Zack, and overturn this devastating new world order. But good and evil are malleable terms now, and the Master is most skilled at preying on the weaknesses of humans. 
Now, at this critical hour, there is evidence of a traitor in their midst. . . . And only one man holds the answer to the Master’s demise, but is he one who can be trusted with the fate of the world? And who among them will pay the ultimate sacrifice—so that others may be saved?

Ignited by the Master's horrific plan, a war erupts between Old and New World vampires, each vying for control. At the center of the conflict lies a book, an ancient text that contains the vampires' entire history . . . and their darkest secrets. Whoever finds the book can control the outcome of the war and, ultimately, the fate of us all. And it is between these warring forces that humans—powerless and vulnerable—find themselves no longer the consumers but the consumed. Though Eph understands the vampiric plague better than anyone, even he cannot protect those he loves. His ex-wife, Kelly, has been transformed into a bloodcrazed creature of the night, and now she stalks the city looking for her chance to reclaim her Dear One: Zack, Eph's young son.   With the future of humankind in the balance, Eph and his team, guided by the brilliant former professor and Holocaust survivor Abraham Setrakian and exterminator Vasiliy Fet and joined by a crew of ragtag gangsters, must combat a terror whose ultimate plan is more terrible than anyone has imagined—a fate worse than annihilation.  <h3>Amazon.com Review</h3> <p><strong>Product Description</strong> </p> <p>The vampiric virus unleashed in </p> <p>Ignited by the Master’s horrific plan, a war erupts between Old and New World    vampires, each vying for total control.

What motivated you to write a novel? </p> <p><strong>Del Toro:</strong> Well, it’s a different challenge, but I've always written short    stories and then, in my film work, storylines for movies (the storyline is a    slightly ""freer"" form than screenplay writing) I have published some of my    short stories in the past and it is my secret dream to write shivery tales for    young readers. My favorite author in that sense is </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You are one of the most extraordinarily imaginative and creative    thinkers working in the arts today. What were some of the influences that have    contributed to your success? Do you have any kind of a muse? </p> <p><strong> Del Toro: </strong>Curiously enough I regularly draw more inspiration from    painters and books than I do from other films. Painters like Carlos Schwabe,    Odilon Redon, Fliecien Rops, Bocklin, Freud, Bacon, Thomas Cole and many    others, never fail to excite me and in the book front there are just as many    authors... </p> <hr />  <p><strong><em></em></strong>Q:<em></em> Many of your movies have centered on fantastical characters. Why    did you choose to write your first novel about vampires? </p> <p><strong><em></em></strong>Del Toro:<em></em> All of my life I’ve been fascinated by them but always from    a Naturalist's point of view. </p> <hr />  <p><strong><em></em></strong>Q:<em></em> There are many stories, movies, and even a television show    involving vampires. The Strain Trilogy uses the idea that vampires are a    plague, and that the lead hunter is a scientist from the Centers for Disease    Control. What was your inspiration for this twist? </p> <p><strong><em></em></strong> Del Toro:<em></em> When I was a kid I loved </p> <hr />  <p><strong><em></em></strong>Q:<em></em> How did you and Chuck Hogan come together to write The Strain    Trilogy? How does your collaboration work? </p> <hr />  <p><strong><em></em></strong>Del Toro:<em></em> It was a true collaboration. I had created a ""bible"" for the    book. It contained most of the structural ideas and characters and Chuck then    took his pass on it and invented new characters and ideas. Fet (one of my    favorite characters) was completely invented by him. And then I did my pass,    writing new chapters or heavily editing his pass, and then he did a pass on my    pass and so on and so forth. This is the way I have co-written in the past. I    loved Chuck's style and ideas from reading his books and I specifically wanted    him as a partner because he had a strong sense of reality and had NEVER    written a horror book. I knew we would complete each other in the creation of    this book. What surprised me is that he came up with some gruesome moments all    on his own! He revealed himself to be a rather disturbed man! </p> <p><strong><em></em></strong> A Q&amp;A with Hammett Award-winner Chuck Hogan<em></em> </p> <hr />  <p><strong><em></em></strong>Q:<em></em> What most surprised you about working with Guillermo Del Toro? Has    working with him impacted your own work? In your former career as a video    store clerk, did you ever in your wildest dreams imagine working on a project    like this—with a legend like Del Toro? </p> <p><strong><em></em></strong>Hogan:<em></em> I'd never co-authored anything, nor had I published a true work    of horror before, and here I was embarking on an epic trilogy with a master of    the genre. I probably should have been more intimidated--yet I felt an    immediate kinship with the material, as well as true excitement at the    challenge of bringing the story to life, both of which carried me through.    Guillermo is a daunting first audience, and yet an incredibly generous    collaborator. Not to mention an amazing resource: it's just fun to have to ask    him a question—say, about why the vampires run hot instead of cold—know that,    not only will he take me through their intricate biology, but he will    embroider the account with corroborating examples from the field of    entomology, marine life, and some arcane fact about the function of human    blood platelets. </p> <p><strong><em></em></strong>Q:_ _<em></em> </p> <p><strong></strong><strong><em></em></strong>Hogan:<em></em> Crime and horror are both genres of existentialism, and I    am drawn to stories of man at his extremes, of people who find themselves    tested, haunted, threatened. I believe a writer should challenge himself in    his work just as he challenges the characters in his story—that anything less    would be inauthentic and dishonest. What I love about <em>The Strain</em> is that the    journey of the story takes this maxim and multiplies it by one thousand. </p>  <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Set over the course of three intense weeks, Del Toro and Hogan's gripping    second volume in their near-future vampire trilogy picks up where The Strain,    the first volume, left off, as the undead, aided by elderly Eldritch Palmer,    one of the world's three richest men, tighten their hold on the planet.    Epidemiologists Ephraim Goodweather and Nora Martinez, Holocaust survivor    Abraham Setrakian, and Vasiliy Fet, ""New York City Bureau of Pest Control    Services worker and independent exterminator,"" oppose the vampires (or    strigoi), as they did in the first book. Setrakian pins his hopes for stopping    the vampires on tracking down a 17th-century grimoire that describes the    origins of their leaders, the Seven Original Ancients. Despite the story's    essential grimness, the authors manage to inject some sardonic humor, even as    the plot developments will leave readers wondering how the concluding book can    possibly end well. </p> <p>Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Delany is one of the most acclaimed writers of speculative fiction. **Babel-17***,* winner of the Nebula Award for best novel of the year, is a fascinating tale of a famous poet bent on deciphering a secret language that is the key to the enemy’s deadly force, a task that requires she travel with a splendidly improbable crew to the site of the next attack. For the first time, **Babel-17** is published as the author intended with the short novel **Empire Star**, the tale of Comet Jo, a simple-minded teen thrust into a complex galaxy when he’s entrusted to carry a vital message to a distant world.

On the orders of Argo, the White Goddess, an itinerant poet and his three companions journey to the island of Aptor. Their mission: to seize a jewel from the dark god Hama and bring it back home. With this precious stone Argo may defeat the malign forces gathered against her and the land of Leptor. But, as the group presses deep into the enigmatic heart of Aptor, easy distinctions between good and evil blur, and somehow the task seems less straightforward. For Argo already owns two of the jewels, and possession of the third would give her unqualified power. And, as the four friends already know, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Samuel R.

"Datlow, Ellen","Ellen Datlow (Editor)","SUMMARY: “Ellen Datlow is the queen of anthology editors in America.”–Peter StraubWith original stories by Jeffrey Ford, Pat Cadigan, Elizabeth Bear, Margo Lanagan, and othersFrom Del Rey Books and award-winning editor Ellen Datlow, two of the most respected names in science fiction and fantasy, comes a collection of fifteen all-new short stories, plus a science fiction novella, that could count as a virtual “best of the year” anthology. Here you will find slyly twisted alternate histories, fractured fairy tales, topical science fiction, and edgy urban fantasy. In “Daltharee,” World Fantasy Award-winning author Jeffrey Ford spins a chilling tale of a city in a bottle–and the demented genius who put it there. In “Sonny Liston Takes the Fall,” John W. Campbell Award-winning author Elizabeth Bear pens a poignant and eerie requiem for the heavyweight forever associated with his controversial loss to Cassius Clay. From hot new writer Margo Lanagan comes “The Goosle,” a dark, astonishing take on Hansel and Gretel. In the novella “Prisoners of the Action,” Paul MccAuley and Kim Newman take a trip down a rabbit hole that leads to a Guantanamo-like prison whose inmates are not just illegal but extraterrestrial. Many of the writers you’ll recognize. Others you may not. But one thing is certain: These stars of today and tomorrow demonstrate that the field of speculative fiction is not only alive and well–it’s better than ever.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Ellen Datlow (Editor)\The Del Rey Book of Science Fiction (3693)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:51:08+02:00","epub","9780345496324","3693","isbn:9780345496324","","Calibre Library","2008-04-28T21:30:00+02:00","Del Rey","3","","1.0","325225","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Space Opera, Adventure, Fantasy, Science fiction; American, Anthologies, Short Stories, Science Fiction - Short Stories, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Short stories; American, Fantasy - Short Stories, Anthologies (multiple authors), Short Story, Fantasy - Anthologies, Science Fiction - Anthologies","The Del Rey Book of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Sixteen Original Works by Speculative Fiction's Finest Voices","Del Rey Book of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Sixteen Original Works by Speculative Fiction's Finest Voices, The","fae2b575-0ef3-4983-8bc6-1b07ea729c08"

"Daniel Suarez","None","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  **Already an underground sensation, a high-tech thriller for the wireless age that explores the unthinkable consequences of a computer program running without human control—a daemon—designed to dismantle society and bring about a new world order**    Technology controls almost everything in our modern-day world, from remote entry on our cars to access to our homes, from the flight controls of our airplanes to the movements of the entire world economy. Thousands of autonomous computer programs, or daemons, make our networked world possible, running constantly in the background of our lives, trafficking e-mail, transferring money, and monitoring power grids. For the most part, daemons are benign, but the same can’t always be said for the people who design them.     Matthew Sobol was a legendary computer game designer—the architect behind half-a-dozen popular online games. His premature death depressed both gamers and his company’s stock price. But Sobol’s fans aren’t the only ones to note his passing. When his obituary is posted online, a previously dormant daemon activates, initiating a chain of events intended to unravel the fabric of our hyper-efficient, interconnected world. With Sobol’s secrets buried along with him, and as new layers of his daemon are unleashed at every turn, it’s up to an unlikely alliance to decipher his intricate plans and wrest the world from the grasp of a nameless, faceless enemy—or learn to live in a society in which we are no longer in control. . . .     Computer technology expert Daniel Suarez blends haunting high-tech realism with gripping suspense in an authentic, complex thriller in the tradition of Michael Crichton, Neal Stephenson, and William Gibson.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\None\Daemon (3696)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:51:08+02:00","epub","9780525951117","3696","isbn:9780525951117","","Calibre Library","2009-01-13T02:00:00+02:00","Dutton, 2009.","4","","1.0","417514","Science fiction, Fiction, Adventure, Suspense, Thrillers, Suspense fiction, American Mystery & Suspense Fiction, Fiction - Espionage, thriller, Technological, Computer programmers, Human-computer interaction, International economic integration","Daemon","Daemon","2819f6a8-1b45-4444-8aa7-d224ad224b2a"

"Cummings, Ray","Ray Cummings","SUMMARY: ""He is a Verne returned and a Wells going forward,"" remarked ""Bob"" Davis, dean of American magazine editors. ""He is the American H.G. Wells,"" say other critics. Cummings has an unusual flair for things scientific as evidenced by the fact that while at Princeton University he accomplished the remarkable feat of absorbing three years of physics in that many months. His five years' association with Thomas Edison as the latter's personal assistant also added to Cummings's scientific knowledge. His bizarre early life, living on orange plantations in Puerto Rico, striking oil in Wyoming, gold seeking in British Columbia, timber cruising in the North, before he was twenty, also left its imprint.  ""Leaving Mr. Edison's employ, Cummings began writing scientific fiction for many magazines. His stories gripped the popular imagination and they ""clicked."" Mr. Cummings's success as a writer has been meteoric, for in a few years he has become one of the world's most popular authors of scientific fiction.... --Argosy-Allstory Weekly, Feb. 8, 1930","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Ray Cummings\The Shadow Girl (3725)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:51:14+02:00","epub","9781434481771","3725","isbn:9781434481771","","Calibre Library","2007-05-28T21:30:00+02:00","Wildside Press","","","1.0","179058","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Adventure, Science Fiction - Adventure","The Shadow Girl","Shadow Girl, The","8556a808-afcb-4f64-ad32-cabad8ae0998"

AN OLD ENEMY RETURNS
In the thousand-sun network of humanity's expansion, new colony worlds are struggling to find their way. Every new planet lives on a knife edge between collapse and wonder, and the crew of the aging gunship *Rocinante* have their hands more than full keeping the fragile peace. 
In the vast space between Earth and Jupiter, the inner planets and belt have formed a tentative and uncertain alliance still haunted by a history of wars and prejudices. On the lost colony world of Laconia, a hidden enemy has a new vision for all of humanity and the power to enforce it.
New technologies clash with old as the history of human conflict returns to its ancient patterns of war and subjugation. But human nature is not the only enemy, and the forces being unleashed have their own price. A price that will change the shape of humanity -- and of the *Rocinante* \-- unexpectedly and forever...

### Review
""A standout tale of violence, intrigue, ambition, and hope. ... Corey cranks up the tension relentlessly in this fast-paced story of heroes and rebels fighting for freedom. With enough thrills and intrigue for three Hollywood blockbusters, the novel stands alone nicely, making it easy for new readers as well as diehard series fans to dive right in.""― ** **Publishers Weekly* on *Nemesis Games**** 
""The science fictional equivalent of *A Song of Ice and Fire*...only with fewer beheadings and *way* more spaceships.""― ** **NPR Books* on *Cibola Burn**** 
""Combining an exploration of real human frailties with big SF ideas and exciting thriller action, Corey cements the series as must-read space opera.""― ** **Library Journal* (Starred Review) on *Cibola Burn**** 
""The Expanse series is the best space opera series running at full tilt right now, and *Cibola Burn* continues that streak of excellence.""― ** **io9*** * 
""Corey's splendid fourth Expanse novel blends adventure with uncommon decency.""― ** **Publishers Weekly* (Starred Review) on *Cibola Burn**** 
""A politically complex and pulse-pounding page-turner.... Corey perfectly balances character development with action... series fans will find this installment the best yet.""― ** **Publishers Weekly* on *Abaddon's Gate**** 
""It's been too long since we've had a really kickass space opera. *Leviathan Wakes* is interplanetary adventure the way it ought to be written, the kind of SF that made me fall in love with the genre way back when, seasoned with a dollop of horror and a dash of noir. Jimmy Corey writes with the energy of a brash newcomer and the polish of a seasoned pro. So where's the second book?""― ** *George R. R. Martin***
""An excellent space operatic debut in the grand tradition of Peter F. Hamilton.""― ** *Charles Stross on* Leviathan Wakes**** 
""High adventure equaling the best space opera has to offer, cutting-edge technology, and a group of unforgettable characters bring the third installment of Corey's epic space drama (after *Caliban's War* and *Leviathan Wakes* ) to an action-filled close while leaving room for more stories to unfold. Perhaps one of the best tales the genre has yet to produce, this superb collaboration between fantasy authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck should reawaken an interest in old-fashioned storytelling and cinematic pacing. Highly recommended.""― ** **Library Journal* on *Abaddon's Gate**** 
""Literary space opera at its absolute best.""― ** **io9* on *Abaddon's Gate****

"Clarke, Arthur Charles","Arthur C. Clarke","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  The countdown to doomsday began with the discovery in 1956 of the neutrino, a particle with no mass and no charge. By the year 2001, the significance of this phantom particle was understood: it was a harbinger. A cosmic event was imminent, and would be close enough to touch. Soon the Sun would go nova; the demolition of Earth was assured. And so it happened in the year 3620.  Over the centuries of knowing the end was at hand, humanity pulled together to launch probes into space. Primitive ships, at first, carrying embryos to distant systems, relying on machines to incubate and rear the first people of a virgin land beneath an alien sun. On Earth the Lords of the Last Days lived with no need to care for the future of the world; it was the wildest of times, and the saddest. Last to leave was the Magellan carrying a million homeless; when cataclysm struck, its voyagers witnessed through telescopes the death of Earth and all its wonders, saw the Atlantic boil dry, the pyramids disintegrate, the land of Antarctica briefly bare of ice before fire consumed everything. Then the million slept.  Five hundred years later, the Magellan must make planetfall to repair its quantum drive.

Now, at the dawn of the twenty-third century,  another ship is discovered hurtling toward us. A  crew of Earth's best and brightest minds is  assembled to rendezvous with the massive vessel. They  are armed with everything we know about Raman  technology and culture. But nothing can prepare them  for what they are about to encounter on board  Rama II: cosmic secrets that are  startling, sensational -- and perhaps even  deadly.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Arthur C.

"Clarke, Arthur C. & Lee, Gentry","Arthur C. Clarke & Gentry Lee","SUMMARY: In the long-awaited conclusion to one of the most heralded science fiction series ever, Arthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee reveal the ultimate Raman plan for humanity. The Hugo and Nebula award-winning Rendezvous with Rama, the bestselling Rama II, and The Garden of Rama were only the prelude to this stunning conclusion to an epic journey. On its mysterious voyage through interstellar space, a massive, alien starship carries its passengers to the end of a generations-long odyssey. For the great experiment conceived by the Ramans has failed. Rama III, with its carefully designed Earth habitat, as well as environments to house other intelligent species, has become a battleground. Instead of creating a utopia, the human contingent has brought forth a tyrant who seeks to conquer the other sectors of the vast Raman ark. Cosmonaut Nicole des Jardins, a lone voice for reason who is now jailed and awaiting execution, is aided in a daring escape by two tiny robots. On New York Island, the dark, brood deserted city in the midst of Rama III's cylindrical sea, Nicole is reunited with her long-lost husband, Richard Wakefield, whom she'd given up for dead. Joined by their children and other rebels from the Earth sector, Nicole and Richard enter New York's labyrinthine underground aboard a ghostly subway hoping to find the ship's secret inner workings. What they find instead is the emerald-domed lair of the technologically advanced species that rules this fabulous subraman world: the octospiders. These arachnidlike creatures are luring Nicole and the rebels into their domain, but the Earth group is divided as to whether the octospiders are allies or enemies - and anxious to discover the fate of two oftheir group abducted by the enigmatic aliens. Yet even as this drama unfolds, Rama III continues its inexorable course to its final destination: the Node. To some, the Node is a vast engineering station; to others, it is a place of wonder and miracles. From here a powerful force ha","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Arthur C.

It is huge, weighing more than ten trillion tons. And it is hurtling through the solar system at inconceivable speed. Then a space probe confirms the unthinkable: Rama is no natural object.

"Chapman, Gary","Gary Chapman","EDITORIAL REVIEW: Marriage should be based on love, right? But does it seem as though you and your spouse are speaking two different languages? *New York Times* bestselling author Dr. Gary Chapman guides couples in identifying, understanding, and speaking their spouse’s primary love language—quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, or physical touch. By learning the five love languages, you and your spouse will discover your unique love languages and learn practical steps in truly loving each other. Chapters are categorized by love language for easy reference, and each one ends with specific, simple steps to express a specific language to your spouse and guide your marriage in the right direction. A newly designed love languages assessment will help you understand and strengthen your relationship. You can build a lasting, loving marriage together. Gary Chapman hosts a nationally syndicated daily radio program called *A Love Language Minute* that can be heard on more than 150 radio stations as well as the weekly syndicated program *Building Relationships with Gary Chapman*, which can both be heard on fivelovelanguages.com. *The Five Love Languages* is a consistent new York Times bestseller - with over **5 million copies** sold and translated into 38 languages. This book is a sales phenomenon, with each year outselling the prior for 16 years running! Includes a promotional code to gain exclusive online access to the new comprehensive love languages assessment.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Gary Chapman\The 5 Love Languages_ The Secret to (3943)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:51:59+02:00","epub","9780802473158","3943","isbn:9780802473158","eng","Calibre Library","2010-09-15T09:00:00+02:00","Moody Publishers","","","1.0","351442","General, Religion, Family, Christian Life, Love & Romance, Love, Interpersonal Communication, Religion - Christian Life, Marriage & relationships, Christian Life - Inspirational - Protestant Self Help, Christian Life - Love & Marriage, Marriage, Communication in marriage, Religion - Relationships, Love & Marriage, Family & Relationships","The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts","5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts, The","82606f00-49b7-4d37-af74-f2113f0c3aac"

"Castro, Adam-troy","Adam-troy Castro","SUMMARY: Andrea Cort became a ""war criminal"" at the age of eight when an unexplained darkness invaded her soul.  Now, decades later, the Devil is calling her.  Employed by the Diplomatic Corps but secretly aiding the AI masters of the universe, Counselor Andrea Cort despises the powerful Bettelhines--unrepentant death merchants who have prospered from the annihilation of civilizations. Now curiosity compels her to answer a cryptic summons to their home world, where the only law is Bettelhine law. But a murder attempt greets her arrival at Xana's orbital entry port--and far graver peril awaits aboard the elevator transport meant to carry Andrea to the planet's surface.  Trapped miles above Xana--surrounded by suspicious Bettelhines, their slavishly loyal retainers . . . and a corpse liquefied by a 15,000-year-old weapon--Andrea must unmask an assassin or die an equally hideous death. But the true reason for her summons--and sordid secrets weaving through her own dark past--threaten to destroy Andrea Cort more completely than the Claw of God.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Adam-troy Castro\The Third Claw of God (4084)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:19+02:00","epub","9780061443732","4084","isbn:9780061443732","","Calibre Library","2009-02-12T21:30:00+02:00","Eos","4","","1.0","347260","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Fantasy, Fantasy - General, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Fiction - Fantasy, Mystery fiction","The Third Claw of God","Third Claw of God, The","8be2a65f-efea-41d4-85cc-29407047b06f"

Under order from the Diplomatic Corps, Counselor Andrea Cort has come to this cylinder world where an indentured human community hangs suspended high above a poisoned, acid atmosphere. Her assignment is to choose a suitable homicide suspect from among those who have sold their futures to escape existences even worse than this one. And no matter where the trail leads her she must do nothing to implicate the hosts, who hold the power to obliterate humankind in an instant.   But Andrea Cort is not about to hold back in her hunt for a killer. For she has nothing to lose and harbors no love for her masters or fellow indentures.

"Carver, Jeffrey A.","Jeffrey A. Carver","SUMMARY: In the century since the devastating War of a Thousand Suns, humanity has stagnated, staying in the cocoon of the Centrist Worlds while the rapacious pirates of Golen Space prey on ships that venture too far into the interstellar Flux. And starship Impris, lost in the war years, has become the stuff of legend--used by the pirates as bait, even as the Centrist authorities deny her existence.  Renwald Legroeder, escaped prisoner and star rigger pilot, has seen what the government doesn't want anyone to see. Framed for treason, he flees--to save himself, and vows to clear his name. He returns to the realm of the pirates to find the truth behind Impris . . . to unmask the conspiracy that cost him his freedom . . . to tear off the blinders that have kept humanity from fulfilling its destiny among the stars.Between Legroeder and redemption lie the pirates' vengeance, if he is caught--and the perils of the Deep Flux, where no man has dared to fly. But with the help of a beautiful pirate renegade named Tracy-Ace/Alfa, he risks everything to uncover the secrets that can clear his name--and change the future of humanity forever.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Jeffrey A.

Carver","SUMMARY: With a plot inspired by chaos theory, fully realized characters, and plenty of twists and turns, this exciting hard SF adventure will keep readers on the edge of their seats. John Bandicut and several aliens and artificial intelligences have been thrown together by a force greater than themselves to prevent cataclysmic disasters on an interstellar scale. Now, before they can take a break after a world-saving mission, they are pulled into a waystation that is being threatened by highly destructive gravity waves.The waves are part of a much larger problem. Something is causing stars to become unstable and go prematurely nova--they're being murdered. When the waystation is destroyed by the gravity waves, Bandicut and his crew barely escape on a jury-rigged ship. Their destination is a star nursery in the Orion Nebula, where sentient stars are being driven to destruction by an artificial intelligence bent on remaking the cosmos in its own image.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Jeffrey A.

"Carpenter, Humphrey","Humphrey Carpenter","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  The authorized biography of the creator of Middle-earth. In the decades since his death in September 1973, millions have read THE HOBBIT, THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and THE SILMARILLION and become fascinated about the very private man behind the books.   	  Born in South Africa in January 1892, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was orphaned in childhood and brought up in near-poverty. He served in the first World War, surviving the Battle of the Somme, where he lost many of the closest friends he'd ever had. After the war he returned to the academic life, achieving high repute as a scholar and university teacher, eventually becoming Merton Professor of English at Oxford where he was a close friend of C.S. Lewis and the other writers known as The Inklings.    Then suddenly his life changed dramatically. One day while grading essay papers he found himself writing 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit' -- and worldwide renown awaited him.     Humphrey Carpenter was given unrestricted access to all Tolkien's papers, and interviewed his friends and family. From these sources he follows the long and painful process of creation that produced THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE SILMARILLION and offers a wealth of information about the life and work of the twentieth century's most cherished author.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Humphrey Carpenter\J.

Instead, it evolved into the Machine Plague, killing nearly five billion people and changing life on Earth forever. The nanotech has one weakness: it self-destructs at altitudes above ten thousand feet. Those few who've managed to escape the plague struggle to stay alive on the highest mountains, but time is running out-there is famine and war, and the environment is crashing worldwide. Humanity's last hope lies with a top nanotech researcher aboard the International Space Station-and with a small group of survivors in California who risk a daring journey below the death line...","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Jeff Carlson\Plague Year (4096)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:21+02:00","epub","9780441015146","4096","isbn:9780441015146","","Calibre Library","2010-03-10T02:00:00+02:00","Ace","4","","1.0","306804","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Science Fiction - High Tech, Epidemics, Nanotechnology","Plague Year","Plague Year","f04e5fa0-b010-4fcb-9f6c-f40266a3d779"

"Scott, Card, Orson","Card, Orson Scott","Speaker for the Dead Nebula and Hugo Award Winner -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Three thousand planet-bound years have fled since Ender Wiggin won humanity's war with the Buggers by totally destroying them. Ender remains young-travelling the stars at relativistic speeds, a hundred years or more might pass while he experiences a month-long voyage. In three thousand years, his books The Hive Queen and The Hegemon have become holy writ, and the name of Ender anathema; he is the Xenocide, the one who killed an entire race of thinking, feeling beings, the only other sapient race humankind had found in all the galaxy. The only ones, that is, until the planet called Lusitania was discovered and colonized. On Lusitania humans found another race of ramen ... a young race, beings just beginning to lift their eyes to the stars and wonder what might be out there. The discovery was seen as a gift to humanity, a chance to redeem the destruction of the Buggers. And so the Pequininos, as they were named by the portuguese-speaking settlers, the ""Piggies,"" were placed off-limits to the colony. The only humans allowed to meet them and speak with them are trained xenobiologists, and then only two at a time. This time, there will be no tragic misunderstandings leading to war. This time... This time, again, men die -bizarrely killed by the Piggies. Andrew Wiggin is called to Lusitania to Speak the deaths of the two xenobiologists, and walks into a maelstrom of fear and hatred. To Speak for these dead, he must first unravel the web of secrets surrounding the lives of the Piggies and those who study them. He must Speak not only for the dead, but for a living alien race. This magnificent sequel to ENDER'S GAME won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award for Best SF Novel of the Year. Orson Scott Card is one of the finest, most innovative writers of the past decade, whose works also include the acclaimed alternate world fantasy series, The Tales of Alvin Maker.

"Scott, Card, Orson","Card, Orson Scott","Children of the Mind Orson Scott Card returns at last to the story of Ender Wiggin, the child hero of the Hugo and Nebula award winner Ender's Game, who as a man found a way to redeem the Xenocide of his youth and restore the Hive Queen to life. Now his adopted world, Lusitania, is threatened by the same planet-destroying weapon that he himself used so many thousands of years before. Lusitania is home to three sentient species: The Pequeninos, a strange race native to Lusitania; a large colony of humans; and the Hive Queen, brought there by Ender. But the Starways Congress fears Lusitania and a strange virus that it harbors, and they have gathered a fleet to destroy the planet. Ender's oldest friend, Jane, the computer intelligence that has evolved with him over three thousand years, allowed the Starways Congress to discover her existence when she tried t stop the fleet. Now they are trying to kill her as well, by shutting down the network of computers and ansibles in which she lives. They are afraid of her and of her control over all human communications. Jane can save the three sentient races of Lusitania. She has learned how to move ships outside the universe, and then instantly back to a different world, abolishing the light-speed limit. But it takes all the processing power available to her, and the Starways Congress is shutting down the Net world by world. Soon she will not be able to move the ships. But there is hope: during the first trip outside, Ender's mind briefly took control and created two new beings - replicas of his brother Peter, who was the Hegemon, and his sister Valentine. These two children of Ender's mind, together with his adopted children from Lusitania, are racing against time to discover new worlds, to influence the Starways Congress to recall the fleet, and to save Jane by finding a home for her disembodied intelligence once the Human Network is closed off to her.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Card, Orson Scott\Enders Game 4 - Children of the Min (4107)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:23+02:00","epub","0765304740","4107","isbn:0765304740","","Calibre Library","2010-06-03T06:00:00+02:00","","","","1.0","412127","","Enders Game 4 - Children of the Mind","Enders Game 4 - Children of the Mind","37a15571-0929-4d57-8908-bb5b3e03510e"

"Scott, Card, Orson","Card, Orson Scott","Ender's Game Nebula and Hugo Award Winner -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- From its first publication in January 1985, Ender's Game quickly became a classic in the science fiction field. It was greeted enthusiastically by the Science Fiction Writers of America, which gave it the Nebula Award for best novel of 1985, and the 1986 World Science Fiction Convention awarded Ender's Game the best novel Hugo. (What really stunned everyone was the following year, when the sequel, Speaker for the Dead, also won both awards -- something no author had ever done before, still less for a book and its sequel!) While Card has gone on to win other awards (two more Hugos, a World Fantasy Award, and in 1996 the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel of the year for his book Alvin Journeyman), Ender's Game continues to be his most popular novel, capturing the imagination of children, teenagers, and adults. Ender's Game has been translated into French, German, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, Czech, Danish, Finnish, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Swedish. Why does the story work so well? Many people call it ""the science fiction novel for people who don't think they like science fiction."" While the trappings of science fiction are there -- spaceships, aliens, futuristic machinery -- the reason the book works for so many people is that it's first and foremost a human story, of a boy who finds the burdens of the world placed on his back. Isolated and alone, his anguish resonates in the hearts of all readers. Yes, kids who read the book really enjoy the whole idea of the Battle School, a three-dimensional playspace where children in special suits have mock combats between armies. Others are intrigued by the military aspects of the book. When the Marine University at Quantico required students in one class to read Ender's Game, it wasn't for the strategy -- tactics in 3D space aren't really a big deal for the Marines. Rather, it was because Ender's Game is virtually a textbook in how to develop a strong relationship between a commander and his troops -- with plenty of examples also in how to fail as a commander. Other people -- especially in the online community -- love Ender's Game because of the powerful role it shows for computer networks in the world of the future. The Internet has taken a few steps in the direction shown by Ender's Game, but we're still a long way from a time when public discourse takes place primarily on the Internet and e-discussions can influence public policy. So Ender's Game is still a dream. Yet others find the ""Mind Game"" most appealing. This is the computer game that students in the Battle School play, allowing their teachers to evaluate their emotional state. Ender, however, forces the computer to reprogram itself to allow him to play the game in new, unpredictable ways. The whole idea of a self-altering game that responds to the needs and desires of the player still intrigues many -- though Card has still not been able to persuade any computer game publishers to develop a self-creating game! Above all, though, Ender's Game is the story of growing up alone, trying to find independence when none is allowed, trying to find meaning in a life whose meaning has already been defined. Almost everyone has at some time felt himself or herself to be in the same kind of no-win situation as Ender Wiggin, and the triumph of the book is not that Ender Wiggin ""wins,"" but that he grows up along the way. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright © 1985 Orson Scott Card A Tor Book - Published by Tom Doherty Associates, Inc.

With all the power of his original creation, Card has created a parallel volume to Ender's Game, a book that expands and complements the first, enhancing its power, illuminating its events and its powerful conclusion. The human race is at War with the ""Buggers,"" an insect-like alien race. The first battles went badly, and now as Earth prepares to defend itself against the imminent threat of total destruction at the hands of an inscrutable alien enemy, all focus is on the development and training of military geniuses who can fight such a war, and win. The long distances of interstellar space have given hope to the defenders of Earth — they have time to train these future commanders up from childhood, forging them into an irresistible force in the high-orbital facility called the Battle School. Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin was not the only child in the Battle School; he was just the best of the best. In this new book, Card tells the story of another of those precocious generals, the one they called Bean — the one who became Ender's right hand, his strategist, and his friend. One who was with him, part of his team, in the final battle against the Buggers. Bean's past was a battle just to survive. He first appeared on the streets of Rotterdam, a tiny child with a mind leagues beyond anyone else's. He knew he could not survive through strength; he used his tactical genius to gain acceptance into a children's gang, and then to help make that gang a template for success for all the others. He civilized them, and lived to grow older. Bean's desperate struggle to live, and his success, brought him to the attention of the Battle School's recruiters, those people scouring the planet for leaders, tacticians, and generals to save Earth from the threat of alien invasion.

Bean was sent into orbit, to the Battle School. And there he met Ender... SUMMARY: Ender's Shadow is being dubbed as a parallel novel to Orson Scott Card's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Ender's Game. By ""parallel,"" Card means that Shadow begins and ends at roughly the same time as Game, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of Shadow, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know. Although it may seem like Shadow is merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous Ender's Game, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of Ender's Game hinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, Shadow manages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that Shadow, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. --Craig E.

The children come from many nations, many religions; while they are being trained for war, religious conflict between them is not on the curriculum. But Dink Meeker, one of the older students, doesn't see it that way. He thinks that giving gifts isn't exactly a religious observation, and on Sinterklaas Day he tucks a present into another student's shoe.This small act of rebellion sets off a battle royal between the students and the staff, but some surprising alliances form when Ender comes up against a new student, Zeck Morgan. The War over Santa Claus will force everyone to make a choice.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Orson Scott Card\A War of Gifts_ An Ender Story (4118)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:26+02:00","epub","9780765358998","4118","isbn:9780765358998","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T21:30:00+02:00","Tor Science Fiction","4","","1.0","85907","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Science Fiction - Adventure, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Sagas","A War of Gifts: An Ender Story","War of Gifts: An Ender Story, A","4ba2fffe-7e9a-4d9c-bb72-7e7eafeb94df"
"Card, Orson Scott","Orson Scott Card","Ender's Game Nebula and Hugo Award Winner -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- From its first publication in January 1985, Ender's Game quickly became a classic in the science fiction field. It was greeted enthusiastically by the Science Fiction Writers of America, which gave it the Nebula Award for best novel of 1985, and the 1986 World Science Fiction Convention awarded Ender's Game the best novel Hugo. (What really stunned everyone was the following year, when the sequel, Speaker for the Dead, also won both awards -- something no author had ever done before, still less for a book and its sequel!) While Card has gone on to win other awards (two more Hugos, a World Fantasy Award, and in 1996 the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel of the year for his book Alvin Journeyman), Ender's Game continues to be his most popular novel, capturing the imagination of children, teenagers, and adults. Ender's Game has been translated into French, German, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, Czech, Danish, Finnish, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Swedish. Why does the story work so well? Many people call it ""the science fiction novel for people who don't think they like science fiction."" While the trappings of science fiction are there -- spaceships, aliens, futuristic machinery -- the reason the book works for so many people is that it's first and foremost a human story, of a boy who finds the burdens of the world placed on his back. Isolated and alone, his anguish resonates in the hearts of all readers. Yes, kids who read the book really enjoy the whole idea of the Battle School, a three-dimensional playspace where children in special suits have mock combats between armies. Others are intrigued by the military aspects of the book. When the Marine University at Quantico required students in one class to read Ender's Game, it wasn't for the strategy -- tactics in 3D space aren't really a big deal for the Marines. Rather, it was because Ender's Game is virtually a textbook in how to develop a strong relationship between a commander and his troops -- with plenty of examples also in how to fail as a commander. Other people -- especially in the online community -- love Ender's Game because of the powerful role it shows for computer networks in the world of the future. The Internet has taken a few steps in the direction shown by Ender's Game, but we're still a long way from a time when public discourse takes place primarily on the Internet and e-discussions can influence public policy. So Ender's Game is still a dream. Yet others find the ""Mind Game"" most appealing. This is the computer game that students in the Battle School play, allowing their teachers to evaluate their emotional state. Ender, however, forces the computer to reprogram itself to allow him to play the game in new, unpredictable ways. The whole idea of a self-altering game that responds to the needs and desires of the player still intrigues many -- though Card has still not been able to persuade any computer game publishers to develop a self-creating game! Above all, though, Ender's Game is the story of growing up alone, trying to find independence when none is allowed, trying to find meaning in a life whose meaning has already been defined. Almost everyone has at some time felt himself or herself to be in the same kind of no-win situation as Ender Wiggin, and the triumph of the book is not that Ender Wiggin ""wins,"" but that he grows up along the way. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright © 1985 Orson Scott Card A Tor Book - Published by Tom Doherty Associates, Inc. Jacket art by John Harris - Jacket design by Carol Russo SUMMARY: Winner of the Hugo and Nebula AwardsIn order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Orson Scott Card\Ender's Game (Ender Wiggins Saga) (4119)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:26+02:00","epub","9780613824224","4119","isbn:9780613824224","","Calibre Library","2010-01-31T21:30:00+02:00","Topeka Bindery","4","","1.0","328421","Science fiction, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Children: Young Adult (Gr. 7-9), Juvenile Fiction, Children's Books, Fantasy & Magic, Ages 9-12 Fiction, Science Fiction; Fantasy; & Magic, Brothers and sisters, Wiggin; Ender (Fictitious character), Wiggin; Ender (Fictitious char, Genetic engineering, Children's 9-12 - Fiction - Science Fiction, War games","Ender's Game (Ender Wiggins Saga)","Ender's Game (Ender Wiggins Saga)","8bffca2c-2f7c-4ab1-a2ff-bbebef1cd5f1"
"Card, Orson Scott","Orson Scott Card","Xenocide The millennia-long saga of Andrew Wiggin called Ender, called The Speaker For the Dead called The Xenocide continues .... On the world Lusitania there are now three sapient races-the Pequeninos, who evolved there; Humans, who came to colonize; and a Hive Queen and her children brought by Ender long years ago. But on Lusitania there is also the descolada, a virus deadly to human beings which would spread like wildfire throughout the Stairways Congress should it ever escape the planet. The Starways Congress decided that The descolada should be wiped out once and for all, and sent a fleet, armed with a planet-destroying weapon, to do it. A fourth intelligence, loyal to Ender and Lusitania caused that fleet to disappear. On a distant world called Path live a people whose culture owes much to that of ancient China on Earth. They have evolved a caste known as the godspoken, people of superior intellectual abilities who pay a terrible price for their gifts. The godspoken of Path have given their loyalty and service to the Starways Congress. Among the god spoken is a young girl named, in The language of her people, Gloriously Bright. It is to her that the Starways Congress turn with the mystery of the disappearance of the Lusitania Fleet. There is no doubt that Gloriously Bright will discover the answer to the puzzle. The question is, what will she do with the information SUMMARY: Orson Scott Card's Xenocide is a space opera with verve. In this continuation of Ender Wiggin's story, the Starways Congress has sent a fleet to immolate the rebellious planet of Lusitania, home to the alien race of pequeninos, and home to Ender Wiggin and his family. Concealed on Lusitania is the only remaining Hive Queen, who holds a secret that may save or destroy humanity throughout the galaxy. Familiar characters from the previous novels continue to grapple with religious conflicts and family squabbles while inventing faster-than-light travel and miraculous virus treatments. Throw into the mix an entire planet of mad geniuses and a self-aware computer who wants to be a martyr, and it's hard to guess who will topple the first domino. Due to the densely woven and melodramatic nature of the story, newcomers to Ender's tale will want to start reading this series with the first books, Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. --Brooks Peck","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Orson Scott Card\Xenocide (Ender Wiggins Saga) (4120)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:26+02:00","epub","9780785716341","4120","isbn:9780785716341","","Calibre Library","2010-01-31T21:30:00+02:00","Tandem Library","3","","1.0","499153","Science fiction, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General","Xenocide (Ender Wiggins Saga)","Xenocide (Ender Wiggins Saga)","f32b1d28-862e-44ef-8dbd-164b984c24e6"
"Card, Orson Scott","Orson Scott Card","Speaker for the Dead Nebula and Hugo Award Winner -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Three thousand planet-bound years have fled since Ender Wiggin won humanity's war with the Buggers by totally destroying them. Ender remains young-travelling the stars at relativistic speeds, a hundred years or more might pass while he experiences a month-long voyage. In three thousand years, his books The Hive Queen and The Hegemon have become holy writ, and the name of Ender anathema; he is the Xenocide, the one who killed an entire race of thinking, feeling beings, the only other sapient race humankind had found in all the galaxy. The only ones, that is, until the planet called Lusitania was discovered and colonized. On Lusitania humans found another race of ramen ... a young race, beings just beginning to lift their eyes to the stars and wonder what might be out there. The discovery was seen as a gift to humanity, a chance to redeem the destruction of the Buggers. And so the Pequininos, as they were named by the portuguese-speaking settlers, the ""Piggies,"" were placed off-limits to the colony. The only humans allowed to meet them and speak with them are trained xenobiologists, and then only two at a time. This time, there will be no tragic misunderstandings leading to war. This time... This time, again, men die -bizarrely killed by the Piggies. Andrew Wiggin is called to Lusitania to Speak the deaths of the two xenobiologists, and walks into a maelstrom of fear and hatred. To Speak for these dead, he must first unravel the web of secrets surrounding the lives of the Piggies and those who study them. He must Speak not only for the dead, but for a living alien race. This magnificent sequel to ENDER'S GAME won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award for Best SF Novel of the Year. Orson Scott Card is one of the finest, most innovative writers of the past decade, whose works also include the acclaimed alternate world fantasy series, The Tales of Alvin Maker.

In that time his name has become anathema, for he is the one who killed an entire race of thinking, feeling beings. No other has been found - until Lusitania is discovered. The young race there offers mankind a chance to redeem the previous destruction. The only humans allowed near are trained xenobiologists. But once again there are tragic misunderstandings. And when Ender, as Andrew Wiggin, is called to Lusitania to speak for the dead - to present to the community the terrible truth of why men have been killed by aliens - his actions can, and will, reverberate through an entire galactic empire.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Orson Scott Card\Speaker for the Dead (4121)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:26+02:00","epub","9781857238570","4121","isbn:9781857238570","","Calibre Library","2010-02-01T02:00:00+02:00","Time Warner Books Uk","4","","1.0","407975","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Wiggin; Ender (Fictitious character)","Speaker for the Dead","Speaker for the Dead","3c2d97b6-9edc-4ac2-8de0-55c1fce27e88"
"Card, Orson Scott","Orson Scott Card","SUMMARY: In Shadow Puppets, Orson Scott Card continues the storyline of Shadow of the Hegemon, following the exploits of the Battle School children, prodigies who have returned to an Earth thrown into chaos after the unifying force of the alien invasion they stopped in Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow has dissipated. Foremost among these whiz kids is the brilliant Bean who, in Shadow of the Hegemon, rescued his comrades from his nemesis--the dastardly Achilles. Now, the down-but-not-out evil genius is again scheming towards global domination and vengeance against the irrepressible Bean. It's up to Bean and his newfound love, Petra, to outwit the young psychopath and save the world. Meanwhile, the other Battle School children are called to serve again as an expansionist China threatens the stability of post-Bugger War Earth. Shadow Puppets is, for better or worse, exactly what readers have come to expect from Card. There are thought-provoking musings on geopolitics, war, courage, arrogance, good versus evil, and the concept of children wise beyond their years dealing with grave responsibility. Unfortunately, many of these furnishings are looking a little frayed around the edges, but fans will enjoy an exciting, fast-paced plot and a suspense-filled conclusion. --Jeremy Pugh","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Orson Scott Card\Shadow Puppets (Ender, Book 7) (Sha (4122)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:26+02:00","epub","9781841491424","4122","isbn:9781841491424","","Calibre Library","2010-01-31T21:30:00+02:00","Orbit","3","","1.0","67811","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fantasy, Sagas, Science fiction - gsafd","Shadow Puppets (Ender, Book 7) (Shadow Saga)","Shadow Puppets (Ender, Book 7) (Shadow Saga)","95991bf5-6629-40c8-a2fc-9c676a5bfd24"

Human beings, while technically “free,” mostly skulk around the fringes of the Satrapy, struggling to get by. The secretive alien Satraps tightly restrict the technological development of the species under their control. Entire worlds have been placed under interdiction, cut off from the rest of the universe. nbsp; Descended from the islanders of lost Earth, the Ragamuffins are pirates and smugglers, plying the lonely spaceways around a dead wormhole. For years, the Satraps have tolerated the Raga, but no longer. Now they have embarked on a campaign of extermination, determined to wipe out the unruly humans once and for all. nbsp; But one runaway woman may complicate their plans. Combat enabled, Nashara is more machine than flesh, and she carries inside her a doomsday weapon that could reduce the entire galaxy to chaos.

Why in all the hells would a being like Technician Nyl vanish right now, when thousands of alien races have been trying to vaporize him for centuries to no avail? And what could he possibly see in a two-bit mudball called the Earth, a radioactive ruin whose last city totters on the brink of disaster, riven from within by plutocrats, druglords, inbred aristocrats and a faltering A.I. overmind?

In the streets, mobs proclaim the ascendancy of Simeon Blaire to the throne of God-Emperor. And below them all, in the teknomantic hades of the R.T., an alien experiment goes horribly awry. Now a shadow which has stalked beside humanity since the dawn of sentience is clothed in flesh - and the Forge might just give it the power to bring about Hell on Earth. Only a tiny group of disparate souls stand in its path - the alien Technician Zhe, the genecrafted warriors Abdulafia and CeeAn, Subcity miscreants Jaq and Kaito... and other, even stranger allies thrown together by chance.  And while the city is torn apart from within, an even greater peril is falling in toward the sun, the cold, calculating planet-killer Everdark, herald of the Motherbrain...

All he knows about them is that their family name is Merss and that they live in a papermaking industrial town called Burz.At first Burz isn’t such a bad place, though the paper mill reeks to high heaven. But the longer he stays there, the stranger it becomes. No one will tell him where to find his relatives. Even stranger, when he mentions the name Merss, people think he’s threatening them. The witches’ coven that every Fenarian town and city should have is nowhere in evidence. And the Guild, which should be protecting the city’s craftsmen and traders, is an oppressive, all-powerful organization, into which no tradesman would ever be admitted.Then a terrible thing happens.

Long ago, he made a place for himself as a captain of the Jhereg, the noble house that runs the rackets in the great imperial city of Adrilankha. But love, revolution, betrayal, and revenge ensued, and for years now Vlad has been a man on the run, struggling to stay a step ahead of the Jhereg who would kill him without hesitation.     Now Vlad’s back in Adrilankha. The rackets he used to run are now under the control of the mysterious “Left Hand of the Jhereg”—a secretive cabal of women who report to no man. His ex-wife needs his help. His old enemies aren’t sure whether they want to kill him, or talk to him and then kill him. A goddess may be playing tricks with his memory. And the Great Weapon he’s carrying seems to have plans of its own…     Picking up directly where *Issola* left off, *Dzur* gives us Vlad Taltos at his best—swashbuckling storytelling with a wry and gritty edge.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Steven Brust\Dzur (4158)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:33+02:00","epub","9780765341549","4158","isbn:9780765341549","","Calibre Library","2007-10-29T21:30:00+02:00","New York : Tor, 2006.","4","","1.0","187533","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fantasy, Fantasy - General, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Epic, Fantasy fiction, Fiction - Fantasy, Fantasy - Epic, Horror, Historical, Horror - General, Fiction - Horror, Taltos; Vlad (Fictitious character)","Dzur","Dzur","578f557a-aea6-438d-b519-903ab58f42c2"

"Dan, Brown,","Brown, Dan","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  From the *New York Times* bestselling author of *The Da Vinci Code* comes an explosive, high-tech thriller that takes readers from the chilling depths of the Arctic Ocean to the treacherous heights of Washington power.    When a new NASA satellite spots evidence of an astonishingly rare object buried deep in the Arctic ice, the floundering space agency proclaims a much-needed victory...a victory that has profound implications for U.S. space policy and the impending presidential election. With the Oval Office in the balance, the President dispatches White House Intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton to the Milne Ice Shelf to verify the authenticity of the find. Accompanied by a team of experts, including the charismatic academic Michael Tolland, Rachel uncovers the unthinkable: evidence of scientific trickery -- a bold deception that threatens to plunge the world into controversy.     But before Rachel can contact the President, she and Michael are attacked by a deadly team of assassins controlled by a mysterious power broker who will stop at nothing to hide the truth. Fleeing for their lives in an environment as desolate as it is lethal, their only hope for survival is to find out who is behind this masterful ploy. The truth, they will learn, is the most shocking deception of all.     In *Deception Point,* bestselling author Dan Brown transports readers from the ultrasecret National Reconnaissance Office to the towering ice shelves of the Arctic Circle, and back again to the hallways of power inside the West Wing.

"Dan, Brown,","Brown, Dan","SUMMARY: While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call: the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum. Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. While working to solve the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of Da Vinci -- clues visible for all to see -- yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.Langdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and learns the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion -- an actual secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, among others. In a breathless race through Paris, London, and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless powerbroker who seems to anticipate their every move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory's ancient secret -- and an explosive historical truth -- will be lost forever.THE DA VINCI CODE heralds the arrival of a new breed of lightning-paced, intelligent thriller…utterly unpredictable right up to its stunning conclusion.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Brown, Dan\The Da Vinci Code (4172)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:35+02:00","epub","9780385504201","4172","isbn:9780385504201","","Calibre Library","2003-03-14T06:00:00+02:00","Doubleday","","","1.0","637615","Fiction, General, Suspense, Paris (France), Fiction - Espionage, Cryptographers, Thrillers, thriller, Secret societies, Mystery & Thrillers, Art museum curators, Leonardo - Appreciation, Appreciation, Mystery fiction, Manuscripts, Mystery, Langdon; Robert (Ficticious character), Crimes against, Leonardo;, Grail, Leonardo, Art museum curators - Crimes against, da Vinci;, 1452-1519","The Da Vinci Code","Da Vinci Code, The","909971e7-2a23-4dfd-9ebb-9df4e37d6822"

"Brooks, Terry","Terry Brooks","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Terry Brooks won instant acclaim with his phenomenal New York Times bestseller The Sword of Shannara. Its sequels earned Brooks legendary status. Then his darkly enthralling The Word and the Void trilogy revealed new depths and vistas to his mastery of epic fantasy. Armageddon’s Children and The Elves of Cintra took Brooks’s remarkable mythos to a breathtaking new level by delving deep into the history of Shannara. And now, The Gypsy Morph rounds out–with an adventure of unforgettably imaginative scope–the first phase of a new chapter in this classic series.Eighty years into the future, the United States is a no-man’s-land: its landscape blighted by chemical warfare, pollution, and plague; its government collapsed; its citizens adrift, desperate, fighting to stay alive. In fortified compounds, survivors hold the line against wandering predators, rogue militias, and hideous mutations spawned from the toxic environment, while against them all stands an enemy neither mortal nor merciful: demons and their minions bent on slaughtering and subjugating the last of humankind.But from around the country, allies of good unite to challenge the rampaging evil. Logan Tom, wielding the magic staff of a Knight of the Word, has a promise to keep–protecting the world’s only hope of salvation–and a score to settle with the demon that massacred his family. Angel Perez, Logan’s fellow Knight, has risked her life to aid the elvish race, whose peaceful, hidden realm is marked for extermination by the forces of the Void. Kirisin Belloruus, a young elf entrusted with an ancient magic, must deliver his entire civilization from a monstrous army. And Hawk, the rootless boy who is nothing less than destiny’s instrument, must lead the last of humanity to a latter-day promised land before the final darkness falls. The Gypsy Morph is an epic saga of a world in flux as the mortal realm yields to a magical one; as the champions of the Word and the Void clash for the last time to decide what will be and what must cease; and as, from the remnants of a doomed age, something altogether extraordinary rises.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Terry Brooks\The gypsy morph (4174)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:35+02:00","epub","9780345484147","4174","isbn:9780345484147","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T21:30:00+02:00","New York : Ballantine Books, c2008.","4","","1.0","511584","General, Fiction, Fantasy, Fantasy - General, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Fiction - Fantasy, Fantasy - Epic, Twenty-first century, Regression (Civilization), Shannara (Imaginary place)","The gypsy morph","gypsy morph, The","45ac4e49-27c9-43ad-ac8e-10612ed5e6ba"

The Illuminati has now surfaced to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy -- the Catholic Church.Langdon's worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the Vatican's holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces they have hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City.

"Broderick, Damien","Damien Broderick & Rory Barnes","SUMMARY: ""Technology has started to accelerate at a terrifying rate. By mid-21st century, we might see a Singularity: a convergence of artificial intelligence, advanced nanotechnologies for building things at the atomic scale, precise genomics, other wonders. What happens after that? Will the descendants of today's humanity become gods or demons, or simply destroy themselves? And will we be among their number, carried along by rejuvenation and immortality treatments? For Natalie and her irritatingly beautiful young sister Suzanna, these are no longer abstract questions. The familiar world is on the brink of crisis. Dumped by her live-in boyfriend and stuck back at home with her parents, Nat is not a happy person. And her father Hugh is acting like a mad scientist. What the hell is he building out there in the garage? When Hugh frog-marches his family into the garage, it looks as if he's really gone mad, and they're due to perish even before the plague wipes out all life on earth. But the machine Hugh has been working on hurls them all--not forgetting their dog Ferdy--ever farther into the future, and the escapade doesn't stop until the very end of time and space""--P.

"Brennan, Marie","Marie Brennan","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  England flourishes under the hand of its Virgin Queen: Elizabeth, Gloriana, last and most powerful of the Tudor monarchs.     But a great light casts a great shadow.    In hidden catacombs beneath London, a second Queen holds court: Invidiana, ruler of faerie England, and a dark mirror to the glory above.  In the thirty years since Elizabeth ascended her throne, fae and mortal politics have become inextricably entwined, in secret alliances and ruthless betrayals whose existence is suspected only by a few.     Two courtiers, both struggling for royal favor, are about to uncover the secrets that lie behind these two thrones.  When the faerie lady Lune is sent to monitor and manipulate Elizabeth's spymaster, Walsingham, her path crosses that of Michael Deven, a mortal gentleman and agent of Walsingham's.  His discovery of the ""hidden player"" in English politics will test Lune's loyalty and Deven's courage alike.  Will she betray her Queen for the sake of a world that is not hers?  And can he survive in the alien and Machiavellian world of the fae?  For only together will they be able to find the source of Invidiana's power -- find it, and break it . . . .

"Braver, Gary","Gary Braver","SUMMARY: Elixir is a novel poised, sometimes awkwardly, between the demands of philosophical speculation and those of hang-on-to-your-hats suspense. Gary Braver's biotech thriller takes as its premise the existence of a fountain of youth: when Chris Bacon, a dedicated medicinal chemist for Darby Pharmaceuticals, journeys to Papua, New Guinea, in search of ""miracle drugs that grow on trees,"" he finds much more than the contraceptive plant steroids he was looking for. He discovers tabukari, the ""forbidden flower of the long day""--a blossom with the power to prolong life. When his bosses, and other powerful and unsavory characters, discover that Chris has successfully synthesized a formula for immortality, the scientist and his family become the targets of a ruthless manhunt. What the bad guys don't know is that Chris didn't stop at injecting lab rats with his elixir; he is himself participating in a dangerous experiment. Braver effectively conveys both Chris's burning desire to test the fruits of his labor, and his wife's prophetic understanding that those fruits are far more lethal than anything Eve might have given Adam: They were silent for a long spell, and Laura felt the old anger burn itself through the sadness. Chris had brought this upon them himself. In a monumentally stupid act he had injected the stuff into his veins thirteen years ago and forever infected the very fabric of their lives. While she understood all the forces that had driven him to that act, she could never forgive him. More than anyone else alive he was able to foresee the consequences but had chosen to disregard them instead. And while she felt pity and compassion for him, there were moments she hated him for what he had done. In addition to metaphysical speculations on the social consequences of living forever, biotech thrillers demand action, suspense, car chases, villains, breathless pursuits, guns, meaningful glances--you name it, Braver provides it, and it's an unholy mess at times. His sense of plot is shaky, and the novel falters whenever it moves away from Chris and his family (and even they can become a bit tedious). But Elixir is more successful than the sum of these parts would seem to allow; in taking on the power of research and genetic manipulation, Braver has plugged into a hot topic, and he largely does it justice. --Kelly Flynn","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Gary Braver\Elixir (4189)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:38+02:00","epub","9780812575910","4189","isbn:9780812575910","","Calibre Library","2000-03-14T21:30:00+02:00","Tor Books","","","1.0","375521","Science fiction, Fiction, Thrillers, Fiction - Espionage, thriller, Americans, Medical, Boston (Mass.), Espionage, Papua New Guinea, Biologists, Elixir of life","Elixir","Elixir","95c1d6a7-7846-4d9e-82d7-ec3203c2c884"
"Bradley, Marion Zimmer","Marion Zimmer Bradley","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  FANGS OF THE WOLF WORLD    Across half a Galaxy, the Terran Empire maintains its sovereignty with the consent of the governed. It is a peaceful reign, held by compact and not by conquest. Again and again, when rebellion threatens the Terran Peace, the natives of the rebellious world have turned against their own people and sided with the men of Terra; not from fear, but from a sense of dedication.    There has never been open war. The battle for these worlds is fought in the minds of a few men who stand between worlds; bound to one world by interest, loyalties and allegiance; bound to the other by love.    Such a world is Wolf. Such a man was Race Cargill of the Terran Secret Service. . . .    At one time Race Cargill had been the best Terran Intelligence agent on the complex and mysterious planet of Wolf. He had repeatedly imperiled his life amongst the half-human and non-human creatures of the sullen world. And he had repeatedly accomplished the fantastic missions until his name was emblazoned with glory.    But that had all seemingly ended. For six long years he'd sat behind a boring desk inside the fenced-in Terran Headquarters, cut off there ever since he and a rival had scarred and ripped each other in blood-feud.    But when *The Door Through Space* swung suddenly open, the feud was on again -- and with it a plot designed to check and destroy the Terran Empire.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Marion Zimmer Bradley\The Door Through Space (4190)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:39+02:00","epub","9781603129527","4190","isbn:9781603129527","","Calibre Library","2010-03-06T02:00:00+02:00","Aegypan","","","1.0","118447","Science fiction, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Space Opera, Science Fiction - Adventure, Science Fiction - Space Opera, Science Fiction - Series, Fiction-Science Fiction - Adventure, Fiction-Science Fiction - Series","The Door Through Space","Door Through Space, The","7933b54a-a28a-479b-b8d4-ec9ebd2578cb"

He was so bored with his own company that the Mentorian medic was a welcome sight when he came to prepare him for *cold-sleep*.    The Mentorian paused, needle in hand. ""Do you wish to be wakened for the time we shall spend in each of the three star systems, sir? You can, of course, be given enough drug to keep you in cold-sleep until we reach your destination.""    Bart felt tempted -- he wanted very much to see the other star systems. But he couldn't risk meeting other passengers.    The needle went into his arm. In sudden panic, he realized he was helpless. The ship would touch down on three worlds, and on any of them the Lhari might have his description, or his alias! He could be taken off, unconscious, and might never wake up! He tried to move, to protest, but he couldn't.

"Bradbury, Ray","Ray Bradbury","SUMMARY: Man, was a a distant shore, and the men spread upon it in wave... Each wave different, and each wave stronger. The Martian ChroniclesRay Bradbury is a storyteller without peer, a poet of the possible, and, indisputably, one of America's most beloved authors. In a much celebrated literary career that has spanned six decades, he has produced an astonishing body of work: unforgettable novels, including Fahrenheit 451 and Something Wicked This Way Comes; essays, theatrical works, screenplays and teleplays; The Illustrated Mein, Dandelion Wine, The October Country, and numerous other superb short story collections. But of all the dazzling stars in the vast Bradbury universe, none shines more luminous than these masterful chronicles of Earth's settlement of the fourth world from the sun. Bradbury's Mars is a place of hope, dreams and metaphor-of crystal pillars and fossil seas-where a fine dust settles on the great, empty cities of a silently destroyed civilization. It is here the invaders have come to despoil and commercialize, to grow and to learn -first a trickle, then a torrent, rushing from a world with no future toward a promise of tomorrow. The Earthman conquers Mars ... and then is conquered by it, lulled by dangerous lies of comfort and familiarity, and enchanted by the lingering glamour of an ancient, mysterious native race. Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles is a classic work of twentieth-century literature whose extraordinary power and imagination remain undimmed by time's passage. In connected, chronological stories, a true grandmaster once again enthralls, delights and challenges us with his vision and his heart-starkly and stunningly exposing in brilliant spacelight our strength, our weakness, our folly, and our poignant humanity on a strange and breathtaking world where humanity does not belong.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Ray Bradbury\Martian Chronicles (4204)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:42+02:00","epub","9780553246919","4204","isbn:9780553246919","","Calibre Library","2010-06-13T01:00:00+02:00","Bantam Books","4","","1.0","235868","Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General","Martian Chronicles","Martian Chronicles","0edba813-9560-4e30-b25c-eccc5a2264ce"
"Bradbury, Ray","Ray Bradbury","SUMMARY: That The Illustrated Man has remained in print since being published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work. Only his second collection (the first was Dark Carnival, later reworked into The October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as ""The Veldt,"" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or ""Kaleidoscope,"" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or ""Zero Hour,"" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. --Stanley Wiater","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Ray Bradbury\Illustrated Man (4205)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:42+02:00","epub","9780886900052","4205","isbn:9780886900052","","Calibre Library","2010-06-13T01:00:00+02:00","Pub Group West","4","","1.0","208493","Audio Adult: Books On Tape","Illustrated Man","Illustrated Man","866fca08-5a62-4711-af79-8dc9a1b4bc40"

"Bradbury, Ray","Ray Bradbury","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  *Two never-before-published novellas by one of America's finest living writers, Ray Bradbury.*     *A journalist bearing terrible news leaps from a still-moving train into a small town of wonderful, impossible secrets . . .     The doomed crew of a starship follow their blind, mad captain on a quest into deepest space to joust with destiny, eternity, and God Himself . . .*      *Now and Forever* is a bold new work from an incomparable artist whose stories have reshaped America's literary landscape; two bewitching novellas that have never before appeared in print—each distinctly different, yet uniquely Bradbury—demonstrating the breathtaking range of the master's talent and the irrepressible vitality of his mind, spirit, and heart.     In *Somewhere a Band Is Playing*, a writer is drawn by poetry and dreams to tiny Summerton, Arizona, a community hidden in plain view, where no small children play, and where the residents never seem to age. Enchanted by its powerful rural magic—and by a beautiful, enigmatic lady who bears the name of an Egyptian queen—the writer sets out to uncover Summerton's mysteries before the inevitable arrival of a ruthless destruction.     With *Leviathan '99*, the author who once colonized Mars returns to the cosmos to brilliantly reimagine Herman Melville's classic masterwork of obsession and the sea, transforming a great whale into a worlds-devouring comet. In the year 2099, fledgling astronaut Ishmael Hunnicut Jones boards the *Cetus 7*, placing his fate in the hands of a relentless madman who is blindly chasing the celestial monster's tail. And in the merciless void, a crew of earthborn and alien star-travelers will face a divine judgment, and an ""enemy"" wielding the most fearsome weapon of all . . . Time.     More than a half century into his remarkable career, Ray Bradbury continues to delight and astound with grand visions, lyrical prose, and provocative thought. Rich in poetry, wonder, imagination, and truth, here is proof positive that the words and stories of the inimitable Bradbury will live on . . . *Now and Forever*.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Ray Bradbury\Now and forever (4207)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:42+02:00","epub","9780061131561","4207","isbn:9780061131561","","Calibre Library","2007-08-22T21:30:00+02:00","New York : Morrow, c2007.","4","","1.0","147161","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Adventure, Fantasy, Science fiction; American, Short Stories, Science Fiction - Short Stories, Epic, Fiction - Fantasy, Fantasy fiction; American, Literary, Fantasy - Short Stories (Single Author), Aeronautics; Astronautics & Space Science, Astronomy, Juvenile Nonfiction, Science, Technology, sears, Arizona, Science fiction., Bradbury; Ray - Prose & Criticism","Now and forever","Now and forever","3a8a388c-5337-49ef-b6e6-b4cc2987d7c2"

In a perfectly executed attack, all of the bridges and tunnels leading into and out of Manhattan are destroyed just as thousands of commuters begin their holiday exodus. With domestic efforts focused on search and rescue, a deadly team of highly trained foreign soldiers methodically makes its way through the city with the singular objective of locating one of their own -- a man so powerful that America will do anything to keep him hidden.Scot Harvath is now the country's only hope.

"Bova, Ben","Ben Bova","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  In the wake of the Asteroid Wars that tore across the solar system, Victor Zacharius makes his living running the ore-carrier *Syracuse**.* With his wife and two children he plies the Asteroid Belt, hauling whatever cargo can be found. When the *Syracuse* stumbles into the middle of a military attack on the habitat *Chrysalis, *Victor flees in a control pod to draw the attacker’s attention away from his family. Now, as his wife and children plunge into the far deeps of space, Victor has been rescued by the seductive Cheena Madagascar. He must do her bidding if he’s to have a prayer of ever seeing his family again.     Elverda Apacheta is the solar system’s greatest sculptor. The cyborg Dorn was formerly Dorik Harbin, the ruthless military commander responsible for the attack on *Chrysalis*. Their lives and destinies have been linked by their joint discovery of the alien artifact that had, earlier, profoundly affected industrialist Martin Humphries. Similarly transformed by the artifact’s mysterious powers, Apacheta and Dorn now prowl the Belt, determined to find the bodies of the many victims of Harbin’s atrocities so that they can be given proper burials.     Kao Yuan is the captain of *Viking*, owned by Martin Humphries, who’s determined to kill Dorn and Elverda because they know too much about the artifact and its power over him. But *Viking*'s second-in-command, Tamara Vishinsky, appears to have the real power on board ship. When *Viking* catches up to Apacheta and Dorn, their confrontation begins a series of events involving them, the Zacharius family, and Martin Humphries and his son in the transformation of the human solar system…","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Ben Bova\The aftermath (4249)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:49+02:00","epub","9780765304148","4249","isbn:9780765304148","","Calibre Library","2007-08-06T21:30:00+02:00","New York : Tor, 2007.","","","1.0","290996","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, High Tech, Space Opera, Adventure, Technology & Engineering, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Science Fiction - High Tech, Space warfare, Bova; Ben - Prose & Criticism, Mines and mineral resources, Asteroids, Mining","The aftermath","aftermath, The","ab4ec1f5-35dc-4761-a1ad-f027d82c817a"

Sortie des cuves matricielles, une nouvelle génération de Scaythes remplace les protecteurs : les effaceurs, qui annihilent la mémoire, le passé, la conscience des humains. Tout semble prêt pour l'avènement de l'informe.  
""Contacte la source, avait dit le Fou des montagnes, ou ce sera la fin des hommes.""  
Shari est l'ultime maillon qui peut relier l'humanité au souffle de vie, reconnecter les siens à leur souveraineté, renverser la volonté des maîtres germes d'Hyponéros. Mais pourra-t-il compter sur l'aide de Jek, âgé de huit ans, de San Frisco, le prince déchu de Jer Salem, et de ces quelques inconscients qui, reliés par un invisible lien, semblent irrésistiblement attirés vers sa petite planète bleue Terra Mater ?

Or, dans l'ombre de la famille régnante, les mystérieux Scaythes d'Hyponéros, venus d'un monde lointain, doués d'inquiétants pouvoirs psychiques, trament un gigantesque complot dont l'instauration d'une dictature sur la Confédération ne constitue qu'une étape.  
Qui pourrait donc leur faire obstacle ? Les moines guerriers de l'Ordre Absourate ? Ou faudrait-il compter avec cet obscur employé d'une compagnie de voyages qui noie son ennui dans l'alcool sur la planète Deux-Saisons ? Car sa vie bascule en ce jour où une belle Syracusaine, traquée, passe la porte de son agence...  
Rares sont les romans français de science-fiction animés d'un véritable souffle épique. Pierre Bordage, dès son coup d'essai, nous livre avec Les guerriers du silence le premier volet d'un authentique opéra de l'Espace.

"Bordage, Pierre","Pierre Bordage","Des siècles se sont écoulés depuis que les cinq cents survivants de l' *Estérion* se sont posés sur le nouveau monde.
Un ensemble de communautés sont nées sur le continent du Triangle, autour de grands domaines agricoles matriarcaux gérés par les mathelles : les chasseurs lakchas qui traquent les troupeaux de yonks ; les djemales, disciples de Qval Djema, à la recherche de l' « éternel présent » ; les ventresecs, nomades des plaines jaunes. Fragile équilibre que celui de cette colonie entre tradition et ignorance.
Les umbres, mystérieux et terribles prédateurs volants, font peser une menace permanente sur sa survie. Des hommes masqués, les protecteurs des sentiers, ont entrepris d'instaurer la terreur au nom d'un dieu oublié de l'arche des origines ; ils ont juré d'éteindre les « lignées maudites ».
Orchéron, fils adoptif d'une mathelle, devenu leur proie désignée, se lance dans une fuite éperdue au bout de laquelle le rejoindront Alma, la jeune djemale boiteuse, et Ankrel l'apprenti chasseur.

En proie à ses doutes, à ses désirs humains, elle attend le donneur sur l´autre rive de la Loire. Mais Solman et ses derniers compagnons de route ont perdu le contrôle de leur radeau sur le fleuve grossi par la fonte des neiges et des glaces. La nature a-t-elle déjà condamné les hommes ?

"Bordage, Pierre","Pierre Bordage","Grâce à Solman, une partie du peuple de l´eau a pu se sortir du piège de Galice et venir en aide à deux Albains, Ibrahim et Kadija, cernés par une nuée de sauterelles venimeuses. Mais tandis que les Aquariotes entament leur périlleux voyage dans l´hiver du Nord, la nouvelle se confirme qu´une guerre totale a été engagée contre les peuples nomades. L´Apocalypse est en marche. Le danger ne vient plus seulement d´une nature hostile, ni d´un adversaire acharné à leur perte, mais des Aquariotes eux-mêmes. Une terrible menace plane alors sur Solman, soupçonné de folie, et sur les deux Albains, jugés indésirables. Pourtant, la clé du salut se cache peut-être dans l´esprit de la troublante Kadija. A-t-elle été envoyée pour aider les derniers hommes à vaincre les légions de l´Apocalypse ?

Une invasion brutale qui dissimule un autre projet : la recherche d'une nouvelle planète habitable.

Ils ignorent qu'une épreuve plus terrible encore les attend. Celle-là mêmepeut-être que devine dans ses visions Ellula, jeune Kropte rebelle mariée d'autorité : un interminable voyage à travers le néant.  
Un jour, Abzalon fait une étrange rencontre dans les souterrains de Doeq. Serait-ce un Qval, un de ces êtres légendaires dont on dit qu'ils furent les premiers Estériens ?  
Or un gigantesque chantier s'achève sur un satellite d'Ester : le projet ""Estérion""...

"Black, Holly","Holly Black","SUMMARY: In the realm of Faerie, the time has come for Roiben's coronation. Uneasy in the midst of the malevolent Unseelie Court, pixie Kaye is sure of only one thing -- her love for Roiben. But when Kaye, drunk on faerie wine, declares herself to Roiben, he sends her on a seemingly impossible quest. Now Kaye can't see or speak to Roiben unless she can find the one thing she knows doesn't exist: a faerie who can tell a lie. Miserable and convinced she belongs nowhere, Kaye decides to tell her mother the truth -- that she is a changeling left in place of the human daughter stolen long ago. Her mother's shock and horror sends Kaye back to the world of Faerie to find her human counterpart and return her to Ironside. But once back in the faerie courts, Kaye finds herself a pawn in the games of Silarial, queen of the Seelie Court. Silarial wants Roiben's throne, and she will use Kaye, and any means necessary, to get it. In this game of wits and weapons, can a pixie outplay a queen?Holly Black spins a seductive tale at once achingly real and chillingly enchanted, set in a dangerous world where pleasure mingles with pain and nothing is exactly as it appears.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Holly Black\Ironside_ A Modern Faery's Tale (4278)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:55+02:00","epub","9780689868207","4278","isbn:9780689868207","","Calibre Library","2007-04-23T01:00:00+02:00","Margaret K.

"Bester, Alfred","Alfred Bester","SUMMARY: When it comes to pop culture, Alfred Bester (1913-1987) is something of an unsung hero. He wrote radio scripts, screenplays, and comic books (in which capacity he created the original Green Lantern Oath). But Bester is best known for his science-fiction novels, and The Stars My Destination may be his finest creation. First published in 1956 (as Tiger! Tiger!), the novel revolves around a hero named Gulliver Foyle, who teleports himself out of a tight spot and creates a great deal of consternation in the process. With its sly potshotting at corporate skullduggery, The Stars My Destination seems utterly contemporary, and has maintained its status as an underground classic for forty years. (Bester fans should also note that Vintage has reprinted The Demolished Man, which won the very first Hugo Award in 1953.)","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Alfred Bester\The Stars My Destination (4285)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:56+02:00","epub","9781857988147","4285","isbn:9781857988147","","Calibre Library","2010-01-31T21:30:00+02:00","Gollancz","4","","1.0","203714","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Genre Fiction","The Stars My Destination","Stars My Destination, The","d2e09689-cb7d-4655-8ca6-09a12b269910"

"Bertel, Erik John","Erik John Bertel","Two scientists, Sarah and Richard discover the existence of a living human ancestor, Homo floresiensis on an isolated tropical island. These small hobbit-like creatures are not the hobbits of JRR Tolkien's stories but a small tribe of prehistoric people called the Ebu Gogo living in seeming isolation for nearly a half million years on the Indonesian island of Irmã Flores. In their unrelenting quest for knowledge, Sarah and Richard unintentionally expose these innocents to the onslaught of the modern world including corporate raiders, Indonesian pirates (sorry, no Johnny Depp types!) and religious zealots. Moreover, while struggling with the magnitude of their find, Sarah and Richard are forced to reconcile their own, very different personalities. In the process of discovery and befriending these ancient people, Sarah and Richard rediscover their own humanity and the opportunity to find true love.  The novel begins with Sarah finding herself clinging for life aboard a small boat that is being tossed about by a tempest in the Flores Sea. Sarah is an attractive young lady and a leading authority on the study of the great apes but she is questioning her own sanity for having taken this journey. This is one of many trips Sarah has made to assist her mentor but this trip takes wrong turn when the boat's engine dies and forcing her and her guides to seek shelter on a small, uncharted island in the Flores Sea.   As the guides repair the motor of their stranded boat, Sarah wanders off from the beach, heading to the woods to observe the local bird population. While she is sitting in the woods she suddenly feels as if she is being watched. Sarah is not easily scared, since she has spent many days alone in the wild while observing her beloved chimps and gorillas. But this experience is entirely different to her and she begins to feels a strange presence closing in about her. Then she actually hears the presence! Strange human-like voices, much like the mumbling's of the damned, begin to fill her ears coming from all directions. Sarah is terrified and paralyzed with fear as they begin to surround her. In the distance Sarah can hear the guides frantically searching for her but it is too late for rescue...  Warning! This adventure/science fiction novel contains contemporary language, numerous naked Ebu Gogo, some sexual situations, depictions of drug use and humor that some might find to be a bit raw. Moreover, this is an adult book filled with violence and is definitely not recommended for young children. Also keep in mind, this book has a complete disdain for almost all authority figures.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Erik John Bertel\Flores Girl_ The Children God Forgo (4288)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:57+02:00","epub","9780982257609","4288","isbn:9780982257609","","Calibre Library","2010-03-06T21:30:00+02:00","Erik John Bertel","","","1.0","307076","Fantasy","Flores Girl: The Children God Forgot","Flores Girl: The Children God Forgot","543bddd2-0b23-435f-9deb-70da33b46a32"

"Bear, Greg","Greg Bear","SUMMARY: The Way is a tunnel through space and time. The entrance is through the hollow asteroid Thistledown and the space station Axis City that sits at the asteroid's center. From there the Flawships ride the center of the Way, traveling to other worlds and times. Now the rulers of Axis City have discovered that a huge group of colonists has secretly entered one of the interdicted worlds along the Way. In some ways Lamarkia is very Earth-like--but its biology is extraordinary. A single genetic entity can take many forms, and span a continent. There are only a few of these ""ecos"" on Lamarkia, and the effect of human interaction on them is unknown. Olmy Ap Sennon has been sent to secretly assess the extent of the damage. But he will find far more than an intriguing alien biology--for on their new world the secret colonists have returned to the old ways of human history: war, famine, and ecological disaster. On this mission, Olmy will learn about the basics: love, responsibility, and even failure...","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Greg Bear\Legacy (Eon) (4297)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:52:58+02:00","epub","9780812524819","4297","isbn:9780812524819","","Calibre Library","1996-04-29T01:00:00+02:00","Tor Science Fiction","3","","1.0","385707","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General","Legacy (Eon)","Legacy (Eon)","9c63ade7-b766-45bb-ab13-142c9b72b0ba"

The man known as Cheradenine Zakalwe was one of Special Circumstances' foremost agents, changing the destiny of planets to suit the Culture through intrigue, dirty tricks and military action.
The woman known as Diziet Sma had plucked him from obscurity and pushed him towards his present eminence, but despite all their dealings she did not know him as well as she thought.
The drone known as Skaffen-Amtiskaw knew both of these people. It had once saved the woman's life by massacring her attackers in a particularly bloody manner. It believed the man to be a lost cause. But not even its machine could see the horrors in his past. 
Ferociously intelligent, both witty and horrific, USE OF WEAPONS is a masterpiece of science fiction.

"Banks, Iain M.","Iain M. Banks","SUMMARY:  
Iain M. Banks, the international bestselling author of The Player of Games and Consider Phlebas, is a true original, a literary visionary whose brilliant speculative fiction has transported us into worlds of unbounded imagination. Now, in his acclaimed new novel, Banks presents an engrossing portrait of an alien world, and of two very different people bound by a startling and mysterious secret. On a backward world with six moons, an alert spy reports on the doings of one Dr. Vosill, who has mysteriously become the personal physician to the king despite being a foreigner and, even more unthinkably, a woman. Vosill has more enemies than she first realizes. But then she also has more remedies in hand than those who wish her ill can ever guess. Elsewhere, in another palace across the mountains, a man named DeWar serves as chief bodyguard to the Protector General of Tassasen, a profession he describes as the business of ""assassinating assassins."" DeWar, too, has his enemies, but his foes strike more swiftly, and his means of combating them are more direct. No one trusts the doctor, and the bodyguard trusts no one, but is there a hidden commonality linking their disparate histories? Spiraling around a central core of mystery, deceit, love, and betrayal. Inversions is a dazzling work of science fiction from a versatile and imaginative author writing at the height of his remarkable powers.

Iain M. Banks is a true original, an author whose brilliant speculative fiction has transported us into worlds of unbounded imagination and inimitable revelatory power. Now he takes us on the ultimate trip: to the edge of possibility and to the heart of a cosmic puzzle....Diplomat Byr Genar-Hofoen has been selected by the Culture to undertake a delicate and dangerous mission. The Department of Special Circumstances--the Culture's espionage and dirty tricks section--has sent him off to investigate a 2,500-year-old mystery: the sudden disappearance of a star fifty times older than the universe itself. But in seeking the secret of the lost sun, Byr risks losing himself.There is only one way to break the silence of millennia: steal the soul of the long-dead starship captain who first encountered the star, and convince her to be reborn. And in accepting this mission, Byr will be swept into a vast conspiracy that could lead the universe into an age of peace...or to the brink of annihilation.

Moons, planets, the very stars themselves, faced destruction, cold-blooded, brutal, and worse, random. The Idirans fought for their Faith; the Culture for its moral right to exist. Principles were at stake. There could be no surrender. Within the cosmic conflict, an individual crusade. Deep within a fabled labyrinth on a barren world, a Planet of the Dead proscribed to mortals, lay a fugitive Mind. Both the Culture and the Idirans sought it.

Lededje Y&#8217;breq is one of the Intagliated, her marked body bearing witness to a family shame, her life belonging to a man whose lust for power is without limit.  Prepared to risk everything for her freedom, her release, when it comes, is at a price, and to put things right she will need the help of the Culture. Benevolent, enlightened and almost infinitely resourceful though it may be, the Culture can only do so much for any individual. With the assistance of one of its most powerful - and arguably deranged - warships, Lededje finds herself heading into a combat zone not even sure which side the Culture is really on.  A war - brutal, far-reaching - is already raging within the digital realms that store the souls of the dead, and it&#8217;s about to erupt into reality. It started in the realm of the Real and that is where it will end.  It will touch countless lives and affect entire civilizations, but at the centre of it all is a young woman whose need for revenge masks another motive altogether.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Iain M.

"Banks, Iain M.","Iain M. Banks","SUMMARY: In a world renowned within a galaxy full of wonders, a crime within a war. For one man it means a desperate flight, and a search for the one - maybe two - people who could clear his name. For his brother it means a life lived under constant threat of treachery and murder. And for their sister, it means returning to a place she'd thought abandoned forever.Only the sister is not what she once was; Djan Seriy Anaplian has become an agent of the Culture's Special Circumstances section, charged with high-level interference in civilisations throughout the greater galaxy.Concealing her new identity - and her particular set of abilities - might be a dangerous strategy. In the world to which Anaplian returns, nothing is quite as it seems; and determining the appropriate level of interference in someone else's war is never a simple matter.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Iain M.

"Banks, Iain M.","Iain M. Banks","The Scavenger species are circling. It is, truly, the End Days for the Gzilt civilization.   

An ancient people, organized on military principles and yet almost perversely peaceful, the Gzilt helped set up the Culture ten thousand years earlier and were very nearly one of its founding societies, deciding not to join only at the last moment. Now they've made the collective decision to follow the well-trodden path of millions of other civilizations; they are going to Sublime, elevating themselves to a new and almost infinitely more rich and complex existence.   

Amid preparations though, the Regimental High Command is destroyed. Lieutenant Commander (reserve) Vyr Cossont appears to have been involved, and she is now wanted - dead, not alive. Aided only by an ancient, reconditioned android and a suspicious Culture avatar, Cossont must complete her last mission given to her by the High Command. She must find the oldest person in the Culture, a man over nine thousand years old, who might have some idea what really happened all that time ago. It seems that the final days of the Gzilt civilization are likely to prove its most perilous.
### Review
""Scotland-resident Banks' Culture yarns, the science-fiction equivalent of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, brim with wit and wisdom, providing incomparable entertainment, with fascinating and highly original characters, challenging ideas and extrapolations, and dazzling action seamlessly embedded in a satirical-comedy matrix.""  

( ** *Kirkus Reviews*** )  

""This rich, sweeping panorama of heroism and folly celebrates the 25th anniversary of the Culture, Banks's far-future semi-utopian society.... The action tumbles along at a dizzying pace, bouncing among a fascinating array of characters and locales. It's easy to see why Banks's fertile, cheerfully nihilistic imagination and vivid prose have made the Culture space operas bestsellers and award favorites."" ( ** *Publishers Weekly*** )  

""One of Banks' best Culture novels to date."" ( ** *Booklist *on* The Hydrogen Sonata*** )  

Praise for *Surface Detail:*  

""Banks' ability to combine humor and horror, the cosmic and the human, as he builds an action-packed story on a moral framework, as well as his wonderfully original characters and, of course, the lavish descriptions of weapons and spaceships, makes *Surface Detail* all you could ask for in a space opera. Nobody does it better."" ( ** *Times* (UK)** )  

""This is an engrossing novel of ideas ornamented by fantastically cinematic set-pieces."" ( ** *The Guardian* (UK)** )  

"" *Surface Detail* is the type of widescreen space adventure we've come to expect from Banks, full of elaborate games, spellchecker-busting names, salty dialogue and, above all, a thrilling sense of the limitless scope SF affords an author's imagination."" ( ** *Financial Times* (UK)** )  

""Banks' labyrinthine and devious ninth Culture space opera novel...adeptly shifts perspective between vast concepts and individual passions."" ( ** *Publishers Weekly*** )

"Banks, Iain M.","Iain M. Banks","The Twin Novae battle had been one of the last of the Idiran war, one of the most horrific. Desperate to avert defeat, the Idirans had induced not one but two suns to explode, snuffing out worlds & biospheres teeming with sentient life. They were attacks of incredible proportion--gigadeathcrimes. But the war ended & life went on. Now, 800 years later, light from the 1st explosion is about to reach the Masaq' Orbital, home to the Culture's most adventurous & decadent souls. There it will fall upon Masaq's 50 billion inhabitants, gathered to commemorate the deaths of the innocent & to reflect, if only for a moment, on what some call the Culture's own complicity in the terrible event. Also journeying to Masaq' is Major Quilan, an emissary from the war-ravaged world of Chel. In the aftermath of the conflict that split his world apart, most believe he has come to Masaq' to bring home Chel's most brilliant star & self-exiled dissident, the honored Composer Ziller. Ziller claims he will do anything to avoid a meeting with Quilan, who he suspects has come to murder him. But the Major's true assignment will have far greater consequences than the death of a mere political dissident, as part of a conspiracy more ambitious than even he can know--a mission his superiors have buried so deeply in his mind that even he can't remember it.
Hailed by SFX magazine as ""an excellent hopping-on point if you've never read a Banks SF novel before,"" Look to Windward is an awe-inspiring immersion into the wildly original, vividly realized civilization Banks calls the Culture.

"Banks, Iain M.","Iain M. Banks","SUMMARY:  
In The Player of Games, Iain M. Banks presents a distant future that could almost be called the end of history. Humanity has filled the galaxy, and thanks to ultra-high technology everyone has everything they want, no one gets sick, and no one dies. It's a playground society of sports, stellar cruises, parties, and festivals. Jernau Gurgeh, a famed master game player, is looking for something more and finds it when he's invited to a game tournament at a small alien empire. Abruptly Banks veers into different territory. The Empire of Azad is exotic, sensual, and vibrant. It has space battle cruisers, a glowing court--all the stuff of good old science fiction--which appears old-fashioned in contrast to Gurgeh's home. At first it's a relief, but further exploration reveals the empire to be depraved and terrifically unjust. Its defects are gross exaggerations of our own, yet they indict us all the same. Clearly Banks is interested in the idea of a future where everyone can be mature and happy. Yet it's interesting to note that in order to give us this compelling adventure story, he has to return to a more traditional setting. Thoughtful science fiction readers will appreciate the cultural comparisons, and fans of big ideas and action will also be rewarded. --Brooks Peck

Now she is hunted by the Huhsz, a religious cult which believes that she is the last obstacle before the faith's apotheosis, and her only hope of escape is to find the last of the apocalyptically powerful Lazy Guns before the Huhsz find her.

"Banks, Iain","Iain Banks","SUMMARY: This brutal tale starts in a bleak, brutal European any-war. Abel and Morgan live in a forboding castle, alone and isolated, until the conflict intrudes on their numb lives in the form of a cruel mercenary lieutenant and her violent, ravaging men who take up residence. From there, the tale disintegrates into darkness and atrocity, punctuated by Abel's memories of earlier joy and pain. Iain Banks pushes the story steadily downward, dragging the morbidly fascinated reader into the depths of human despair. Gang rape, torture, and incest are seen through Abel's uncaring eyes--this book is not for the squeamish. And although Banks strives for a Passion play in the end, what's missing is even the tiniest kernel of real redemption. Fans of The Wasp Factory and Banks's other non-science fiction works will find familiar details here, but A Song of Stone stands alone as a fable of hopelessness. --Therese Littleton","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Iain Banks\A Song of Stone (4333)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:53:05+02:00","epub","9780349110110","4333","isbn:9780349110110","","Calibre Library","2010-06-19T01:00:00+02:00","Abacus","2","","1.0","190238","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fantasy","A Song of Stone","Song of Stone, A","54edfda1-ea74-4e7f-9806-ff3581e61f37"

London is a city now inundated by a primeval swamp, to which an expedition travels to record the flora and fauna of this new Triassic Age.

"Ballard, J. G.","J. G. Ballard","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Long-regarded as one of the true visionary writers of the twentieth century, J.G. Ballard was one of the first British writers of the post-War period to begin to see, and to map out in his fiction, the future course of our civilization. For forty years his unflinching eye has turned to the point where the advancing edge of our technological progress has worn away our inner humanity. Eden-Olympia is more than just a multinational business park, it is a virtual city-state in itself, with the latest in services and facilities for the most elite high-tech industries. Isolated and secure, overlooking the luxurious French Riviera, the residents lack nothing. Yet one day Doctor Greenwood from Eden-Olympia's clinic goes on a suicidal shooting spree. Dr. Jane Sinclair is hired as his replacement, and she and her husband Paul are given Dr. Greenwood's house as a residence.Unable to work while recovering from an accident, Paul spends his days taking a close look at the house where Dr. Greenwood shot himself and three hostages. He discovers clues in the house lead him to question Eden-Olympia's official account of the killings. Drawn into investigating the activities of the park's leading citizens, while Jane is lured deeper into Eden-Olympia's inner workings, Paul uncovers the dangerous psychological vents that maintain Eden-Olympia's smoothly-running surface. An experiment is underway at Eden-Olympia, an experiment in power and brutality. Soon Paul finds himself in race to save himself and his wife before they're crushed by forces that may be beyond anyone's control.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\J. G.

A woman with feline genes, bred for sex slavery. A man who kills to protect his pet. Two truckers who don?t care about laws designed for the cities.

Altered Humans is a novel set in the days before the pet plague reaches its peak, where society is in flux, where survival is for the strong, but where goodness and generosity can still be found?if you don?t die first.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Darrell Bain\Altered Humans (4347)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:53:07+02:00","epub","2940000085202","4347","isbn:2940000085202","","Calibre Library","2010-03-07T02:00:00+02:00","","","","1.0","166756","Science fiction","Altered Humans","Altered Humans","b13e1bfb-0c1c-49d4-b9d9-fb3112b2b7e8"
"Bain, Darrell","Darrell Bain","SUMMARY: When Mark and Alice decide to install a program of their own devising into the only quantum computer in the world, wildly unintended consequences occur. The computer not only becomes self-aware, but the new program produces an unchangeable core directive which impels it to protect Mark and Alice as well as itself. It doesn't matter what the political, religious and military establishments think of a sentient computer running rampant on the internet and into secret files of governments all over the world, or what they try in order to stop it. Quanty intends to protect Mark and Alice and itself with all the power at its command no matter who gets hurt or helped in the process. The result is Mark and Alice becoming the focus of governments, spies and the military of every nation, since only they can control Quanty. Or can they? They're on the run but Quanty's unasked for ""help"" causes them to fall into one disaster after another, with no end in sight.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Darrell Bain\Quanty (4348)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:53:08+02:00","epub","9781554046690","4348","isbn:9781554046690","","Calibre Library","2009-04-24T21:30:00+02:00","Double Dragon Publishing","","","1.0","283498","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General","Quanty","Quanty","4d8a0af6-cfe7-401e-9a1c-349446a1dde3"

"Bacigalupi, Paolo","Paolo Bacigalupi","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  *Winner of the 2010 Nebula Award for Best Novel* In this Time Magazine top 10 book of the year, Anderson Lake is a company man, AgriGen's Calorie Man in Thailand. Under cover as a factory manager, Anderson combs Bangkok's street markets in search of foodstuffs thought to be extinct, hoping to reap the bounty of history's lost calories. There, he encounters Emiko. Emiko is the Windup Girl, a strange and beautiful creature. One of the New People, Emiko is not human; instead, she is an engineered being, creche-grown and programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of a Kyoto businessman, but now abandoned to the streets of Bangkok. Regarded as soulless beings by some, devils by others, New People are slaves, soldiers, and toys of the rich in a chilling near future in which calorie companies rule the world, the oil age has passed, and the side effects of bio-engineered plagues run rampant across the globe. What Happens when calories become currency? What happens when bio-terrorism becomes a tool for corporate profits, when said bio-terrorism's genetic drift forces mankind to the cusp of post-human evolution? In The Windup Girl, award-winning author Paolo Bacigalupi returns to the world of The Calorie Man; (Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award-winner, Hugo Award nominee, 2006) and Yellow Card Man (Hugo Award nominee, 2007) in order to address these poignant questions. This title has been nominated for both the Hugo and Nebula awards. This title was also on the best book lists of the year for Library Journal and Publishers Weekly.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Paolo Bacigalupi\The Windup Girl (4351)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:53:08+02:00","epub","9781597801584","4351","isbn:9781597801584","","Calibre Library","2010-06-15T01:00:00+02:00","Night Shade Books","4","","1.0","414122","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, High Tech, Fantasy, Short Stories, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Fiction - Fantasy, Science Fiction - High Tech, Fantasy - Short Stories, Social aspects, Bioterrorism","The Windup Girl","Windup Girl, The","2024f4f1-65bd-4c31-a8c3-6f17c3633f21"

"Asimov, Isaac","Isaac Asimov","SUMMARY: The Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov are one of the great masterworks of science fiction. Unsurpassed for their unique blend of nonstop action, daring ideas, and extensive world-building, they chronicle the struggle of a courageous group of men and women to preserve humanity’s light against an inexorable tide of darkness and violence.Led by its founding father, the great psychohistorian Hari Seldon, and taking advantage of its superior science and technology, the Foundation has survived the greed and barbarism of its neighboring warrior-planets. Yet now it must face the Empire—still the mightiest force in the Galaxy even in its death throes. When an ambitious general determined to restore the Empire’s glory turns the vast Imperial fleet toward the Foundation, the only hope for the small planet of scholars and scientists lies in the prophecies of Hari Seldon.But not even Hari Seldon could have predicted the birth of the extraordinary creature called The Mule—a mutant intelligence with a power greater than a dozen battle fleets…a power that can turn the strongest-willed human into an obedient slave.From the Paperback edition.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Isaac Asimov\Foundation and Empire (4381)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:53:13+02:00","epub","9780553382587","4381","isbn:9780553382587","","Calibre Library","2010-01-31T21:30:00+02:00","Spectra","4","","1.0","234265","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction - General, Science Fiction And Fantasy, Science Fiction - Series","Foundation and Empire","Foundation and Empire","d1fff2d2-c73e-49f3-b041-2627f5bc6116"

"Asher, Neal","Neal Asher","SUMMARY: Full-scale action SF by one of Britain's most popular new writers. Outlink station Miranda has been destroyed by a nanomycelium, and the very nature of this sabotage suggests that the alien bioconstruct Dragon - a creature as untrustworthy as it is gigantic - is somehow involved. Sent out on a titanic Polity dreadnought, the Occam Razor, agent Cormac must investigate the disaster. Meanwhile, on the remote planet Masada, the long-term rebellion can never rise above-ground, as the slave population is subjugated by orbital laser arrays controlled by the Theocracy in their cylinder worlds, and by the fact that they cannot safely leave their labour compounds. For the wilderness of Masada lacks breathable air ... and out there roam monstrous predators called hooders and siluroynes, not to mention the weird and terrible gabbleducks.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Neal Asher\The Line of Polity (4383)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:53:14+02:00","epub","9780330512565","4383","isbn:9780330512565","","Calibre Library","2009-10-01T21:30:00+02:00","Tor","3","","1.0","440906","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Space Opera, Adventure, Science Fiction - Adventure, Science Fiction - Space Opera","The Line of Polity","Line of Polity, The","3b2a1659-9016-4d8b-af49-4d5403640b66"

Councilman Golan Trevize is wondering if he was right to choose a collective mind as the best possible future for humanity over the anarchy of contentious individuals, nations and planets. To test his conclusion, he decides he must know the past and goes in search of legendary Earth, all references to which have been erased from galactic libraries. The societies encountered along the way become arguing points in a book-long colloquy about man's fate, conducted by Trevize and traveling companion Bliss, who is part of the first world/mind, Gaia.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Isaac Asimov\Foundation and Earth (4384)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:53:14+02:00","epub","9781439507223","4384","isbn:9781439507223","","Calibre Library","2010-01-31T21:30:00+02:00","","3","","1.0","382827","Science fiction, Fiction, Science Fiction - General","Foundation and Earth","Foundation and Earth","6c3ec15d-5fed-49b8-a209-770e5bead12f"

"Asher, Neal","Neal Asher","SUMMARY: The Polity is under attack from a āmeldedā AI entity with control of the lethal Jain technology, yet the attack seems to have no coherence. When one of Erebusās wormships kills millions on the world of Klurhammon, a high-tech agricultural world of no real tactical significance, agent Ian Cormac is sent to investigate, though he is secretly struggling to control a new ability no human being should possess . . . and beginning to question the motives of his AI masters. Further attacks and seemingly indiscriminate slaughter ensue, but only serve to bring some of the most dangerous individuals in the Polity into the war. Mr Crane, the indefatigable brass killing machine sets out for vengeance, while Orlandine, a vastly-augmented haiman who herself controls Jain technology, seeks a weapon of appalling power and finds allies from an ancient war. Meanwhile Mika, scientist and Dragon expert, is again kidnapped by that unfathomable alien entity and dragged into the heart of things: to wake the makers of Jain technology from their five-million-year slumber. But Erebusās attacks are not so indiscriminate, after all, and could very well herald the end of the Polity itself . . .","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Neal Asher\Line war (4403)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:53:17+02:00","epub","9780330441544","4403","isbn:9780330441544","","Calibre Library","2009-04-30T21:30:00+02:00","Great Britain : Pan Macmillan, 2009.","","","1.0","368490","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Space Opera, Fiction & related items","Line war","Line war","1f4b3243-7b33-4be4-ab1b-de519da36cfe"

The Gates of Winter The enigmatic Shemal has known only two Runebreakers. One, her rival Kelephon, served the Pale King and his army of apocalypse. The other was Travis Wilder, the Runebreaker of prophecy.Now, in outcast and newly made Runebreaker Larad, Shemal has found a weapon to open the door between worlds. As the shadow of Shemal's master, the vengeful god Mohg, Lord of Nightfall, looms, Grace Beckett seeks to harness wild magic and Travis Wilder joins her in the struggle between warriors and mages, witches and kings and betrayers of every form. As the time of final reckoning approaches, Travis and Grace will find themselves facing a dark conspiracy of evil whose virulence threatens to overwhelm anyone who stands in its way. Yet if they don't succeed in stopping it, two worlds will be lost forever.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Mark Anthony\The Gates of Winter (The Last Rune, (4416)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:53:38+02:00","epub","9780553583335","4416","isbn:9780553583335","","Calibre Library","2003-07-28T21:30:00+02:00","Spectra","","","1.0","885336","General, Fiction, Fantasy, Contemporary, Magic, Fantasy fiction, Fiction - Fantasy, Fantasy - Contemporary, Imaginary places, Good and evil, Wilder; Travis (Fictitious character), Beckett; Grace (Fictitious character), Gods","The Gates of Winter (The Last Rune, Book 5)","Gates of Winter (The Last Rune, Book 5), The","cb402b2e-5513-4687-9874-a55feba06f10"

But because the origin of the alien signals is thousands of light-years away, the crew will age only a few years while millennia pass on Earth.

But not all League members played fair when trading, nor did some of the non-human races of the galaxy object to dirty tricks. Van Rijn could not be everywhere, and relied on his representatives, foremost among them his young protege, David Falkayn, and the members of David's trader team: Adzel, a large dragon-likr being who practiced Buddhism, and Chee-Lan, a brilliant but hot-tempered felinesque extraterrestrial.  This is the second volume in the first complete edition of Poul Anderson's Technic Civilization saga.

The Wersgorix, whose scouting ship it is, are quite expert at taking over planets, and having determined from orbit that this one was suitable, they initiate standard world-conquering procedure. Ah, but this time it's no mere primitives the Wersgorix seek to enslave-they've launched their invasion against Englishmen!

Ginny Greylock and Steven Matuchek are partners an Earth quite unlike our own. For starters, Ginny is a licensed witch and Steve is an engineer and werewolf. Steve moonlights by working on a spacecraft in the Arizona desert, a project which soon discovers that there is life on the moon.

But when the time comes to test the spacecraft, a host of bugs, snafus, and angry spirits conspire to prevent the launch.

Anderson","SUMMARY: Dune: House Harkonnencontinues t he unforgettable saga begun inDune: House Atreides, as a vast array of rich and complex figures strives to shape a sprawling universe of mystery and vivid universe revealed in the thrilling pages of Frank Herbert'sDune. Dune: House Harkonnen At last Shaddam sits on the Golden Lion Throne, his precarious position as ruler of the Known Universe dependent on producing a male heir. But his leadership is further threatened by the ambitious Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, whose insatiable thirst for dominance leads him to plot against some of t he most powerful forced in the Imperium, hoping to elevate his own ruthless House to unprecedented heights of power. His primary targets: House Atreides and the mysterious Bene Gasserit Sisterhood. The Sisterhood are unaware of this threat as they prepare to culminate the work of centuries in the creation of a god-child who will sweep away emperors, houses, and history itself in a terrifying new order of religious tyranny. The desert world Dune, the machine world IX, and countless other conquered planets groan under the numbing slavery of cruel new masters determined to exploit their resources - most notably the addictive spice melange found only on Dune. But small bands of renegades begin to fight back, lighting the spark of freedom against overwhelming odds. New, unexpected heroes arise: young and resourceful Liet-Kynes on Dune, wily and patient C'tair on IX, and the unyielding Gurney Halleck in Giedi Prime, driven to vengeance against his Harkonnen overlords. For Leto Atreides, grown complacent and comfortable as ruler of his House, it is time of momentous choice: between love and honor, friendship and duty, safety and destiny. Leto has finally produced an heir to House Atreides, Victor, and will make whatever choices necessary to protect the young boy and ensure his legacy as Duke. Ultimately, however, for House Atreides there is just one choice - strive for greatness or crushed.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Brian Herbert,Kevin J.

Anderson bring us the magnificent final chapter in the unforgettable saga begun in **Dune: House Atreides** and continued in **Dune: House Harkonnen**. Here nobles and commoners, soldiers and slaves, wives and courtesans shape the amazing destiny of a tumultuous universe. An epic saga of love and war, crime and politics, religion and revolution, this magnificent novel is a fitting conclusion to a great science fiction trilogy ... and an invaluable addition to the thrilling world of Frank Herbert’s immortal **Dune**.**Dune: House Corrino**Fearful of losing his precarious hold on the Golden Lion Throne, Shaddam IV, Emperor of a Million Worlds, has devised a radical scheme to develop an alternative to melange, the addictive spice that binds the Imperium together and that can be found only on the desert world of Dune. In subterranean labs on the machine planet Ix, cruel Tleilaxu overlords use slaves and prisoners as part of a horrific plan to manufacture a synthetic form of melange known as amal. If amal can supplant the spice from Dune, it will give Shaddam what he seeks: absolute power.But Duke Leto Atreides, grief-stricken yet unbowed by the tragic death of his son Victor, determined to restore the honor and prestige of his House, has his own plans for Ix. He will free the Ixians from their oppressive conquerors and restore his friend Prince Rhombur, injured scion of the disgraced House Vernius, to his rightful place as Ixian ruler. It is a bold and risky venture, for House Atreides has limited military resources and many ruthless enemies, including the sadistic Baron Harkonnen, despotic master of Dune. Meanwhile, Duke Leto’s consort, the beautiful Lady Jessica, obeying the orders of her superiors in the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, has conceived a child that the Sisterhood intends to be the penultimate step in the creation of an all-powerful being. Yet what the Sisterhood doesn’t know is that the child Jessica is carrying is not the girl they are expecting, but a boy. Jessica’s act of disobedience is an act of love — her attempt to provide her Duke with a male heir to House Atreides — but an act that, when discovered, could kill both mother and baby. Like the Bene Gesserit, Shaddam Corrino is also concerned with making a plan for the future — securing his legacy. Blinded by his need for power, the Emperor will launch a plot against Dune, the only natural source of true spice. If he succeeds, his madness will result in a cataclysmic tragedy not even he foresees: the end of space travel, the Imperium, and civilization itself.With Duke Leto and other renegades and revolutionaries fighting to stem the tide of darkness that threatens to engulf their universe, the stage is set for a showdown unlike any seen before.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Brian Herbert\Dune_ House Corrino (4436)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:53:46+02:00","epub","9780553110845","4436","isbn:9780553110845","","Calibre Library","2001-03-14T21:30:00+02:00","Bantam Books","3","","1.0","522141","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, Dune (Imaginary place), Science Fiction - General","Dune: House Corrino","Dune: House Corrino","319595c6-84a7-464f-829f-4799fb742a71"

"Aldiss, Brian W.","Brian W. Aldiss","SUMMARY: a selection from CHAPTER ONE: On the ground, new blades of grass sprang up in chlorophyll coats. On the trees, tongues of green protruded from boughs and branches, wrapping them about - soon the place would look like an imbecile Earthchild's attempt to draw Christmas trees - as spring again set spur to the growing things in the southern hemisphere of Dapdrof. Not that nature was more amiable on Dapdrof than elsewhere. Even as she sent the warmer winds over the southern hemisphere, she was sousing most of the northern in an ice-bearing monsoon. Propped on G-crutches, old Aylmer Ainson stood at his door, scratching his scalp very leisurely and staring at the budding trees. Even the slenderest outmost twig shook very little, for all that a stiffish breeze blew. This leaden effect was caused by gravity; twigs, like everything else on Dapdrof. weighed three times as much as they did on Earth. Ainson was long accustomed to the phenomenon. His body had grown round-shouldered and hollow-chested accustoming him to it. His brain had grown a little round-shouldered in the process. Fortunately he was not afflicted with the craving to recapture the past that strikes down so many humans even before they reach middle age. The sight of infant green leaves woke in him only the vaguest nostalgia, roused in him only the faintest recollection that his childhood had been passed among foliage more responsive to April's zephyrs - zephyrs, moreover, a hundred light years away. He was free to stand in the doorway and enjoy man's richest luxury, a blank mind. Idly, he watched Quequo. the female utod, as she trod between her salad beds and under the ammp trees to launch her body into the bolstering mud. The ammp trees were evergreen, unlike the rest of the trees in Ainson's enclosure. Resting in the foliage on the crest of them were big four-winged white birds, which decided to take off as Ainson looked at them, fluttering up like immense butterflies and splashing their shadows across the house as they passed. But the house was already splashed with their shadows. Obeying the urge to create a work of art that visited them perhaps only once in a century, Ainson's friends had broken the white of his walls with a scatterbrained scattering of silhouetted wings and bodies, urging upwards. The lively movement of this pattern seemed to make the low-eaved house rise against gravity; but that was appearance only, for this spring found the neoplastic rooftree sagging and the supporting walls considerably buckled at the knees. This was the fortieth spring Ainson had seen flow across his patch of Dapdrof. Even the ripe stench from the mid-denstead now savoured only of home. As he breathed it in, his grorg or parasite-eater scratched his head for him; reaching up, Ainson returned the compliment and tickled the lizard-like creature's cranium. He guessed what the grorg really wanted, but at that hour, with only one of the suns up, it was too chilly to join Snok Snok Karn and Quequo Kifful with their grorgs for a wallow in the mire. ""I'm cold standing out here. I am going inside to lie down,"" he called to Snok Snok in the utodian tongue. The young utod looked up and extended two of his limbs in a sign of understanding. That was gratifying. Even after forty years* study, Ainson found the utodian language full of conundrums. He had not been sure that he had not said. ""The stream is cold and I am going inside to cook it."" Catching the right whistling inflected scream was not easy: he had only one sound orifice to Snok Snok's eight. He swung his crutches and went in. ""His speech is growing less distinct than it was,"" Quequo remarked. ""We had difficulty enough teaching him to communicate. He is not an efficient mechanism, this manlegs. You may have noticed that he is moving more slowly than he did.""","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Brian W.

Kregen is an Earthlike world, but strange, far stranger, than ours. For it is the scene of a conflict between galactic powers who utilize its many human nations and its astonishing variety of humanoid peoples as their battleground. Dray Prescot of Earth had been a tool of those powers, but courage and ingenuity had won him a high role in the Vallian Empire and a certain independence of his own. Thus when a mysterious monster cult began to undermine the empire and when his own beloved princess became a victim of those secret schemers, Prescot had to go into action. Secret Scorpio launches a new cycle in the magnificent history of Kregen and brings Prescot at long last into direct confrontation with the forces that had once dared make him their pawn.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Alan Burt Akers\Secret Scorpio (4467)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:53:55+02:00","epub","9781843195429","4467","isbn:9781843195429","","Calibre Library","2007-05-01T21:30:00+02:00","Mushroom Publishing","","","1.0","219361","Science fiction, General, Fiction, High Tech, Space Opera, Adventure, Short Stories, Life on other planets, Quests (Expeditions)","Secret Scorpio","Secret Scorpio","0010043c-0046-46be-a296-1ddb36fcbc94"

For treason struck at the court, while rebel armies marched from the backlands, the war fleets of enemy nations were aloft, and the uncanny wizardry of a master scientist launched a spell of doom for all Prescot held dear. With his back to the wall, Dray Prescot faced that time of peril with unflinching will... until the cruelest blow of all was struck: his warrior daughter Dayra rode in the vanguard of his foes!","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Alan Burt Akers\Captive Scorpio (4468)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:53:55+02:00","epub","9781843195719","4468","isbn:9781843195719","","Calibre Library","2007-05-22T21:30:00+02:00","Mushroom Publishing","","","1.0","229948","Science fiction, General, Fiction, High Tech, Space Opera, Adventure, Fantasy, Imaginary wars and battles, Imaginary places, Fathers and daughters","Captive Scorpio","Captive Scorpio","b868e5f8-ad63-4202-aa38-8c1ea91adaa2"

"Akers, Alan Burt","Alan Burt Akers","SUMMARY: Never before in his adventurous career under the double suns of Antares had Dray Prescot been in as desperate a situation as he found himself on his second entry into the city of Magdag. Magdag had been the scene of one of Prescot's earliest experiences on Kregen and he recalled it with loathing as a city of power-lusting slavers, of decadent worshippers of the Green Sun. As one who had been initiated into the chivalric order of Krozairs, he despised all that that city stood for. But now Prescot was an outcast. Any Krozair, any follower of the Red Sun of his former friends, would slay him on sight. For him there was only one way to recover his home, his children, his self-respect. He would have to perform an act of valor so extreme, so fabulous, that its glory would wash away all that now stained his name. Only by reaching to the very heart of mighty Magdag could he hope to achieve such a suicidal triumph.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Alan Burt Akers\Renegade of Kregen (4470)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:53:56+02:00","epub","9781843195269","4470","isbn:9781843195269","","Calibre Library","2007-04-03T21:30:00+02:00","Mushroom Publishing","","","1.0","217110","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Adventure, Imaginary wars and battles, Imaginary places","Renegade of Kregen","Renegade of Kregen","1b0c6702-163c-479d-b54b-c9ccbc81120c"

"Stephenson, Neal","Neal Stephenson","SUMMARY: With this extraordinary first volume in what promises to be an epoch-making masterpiece, Neal Stephenson hacks into the secret histories of nations and the private obsessions of men, decrypting with dazzling virtuosity the forces that shaped this century.In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy's fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces.Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse's crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a ""data haven"" in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe's tough-as-nails grandaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi sumarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn.A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson's most accomplished and affecting work to date, CRYPTONOMICON is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day-after-tomorrow. It is a work of great art, thought, and creative daring; the product of a truly icon","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Neal Stephenson\Cryptonomicon (4675)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:59:14+02:00","epub","9780380788620","4675","isbn:9780380788620","","Calibre Library","2000-04-19T01:00:00+02:00","New York : Perennial, 2000, c1999.","4","","1.0","1440231","Science fiction, General, Fiction, High Tech, Thrillers, Historical, Fiction - Espionage, thriller, World War; 1939-1945, Adventure fiction, Literary, Espionage, Historical - General, Technological, Intrigue, Code and cipher stories, World Wide Web, World War; 1939-1945 - Cryptography, Data encryption (Computer science)","Cryptonomicon","Cryptonomicon","82fbc13c-ca05-48c8-8e18-7af53d76fa3d"
"Stephenson, Neal","Neal Stephenson","SUMMARY: From the opening line of his breakthrough cyberpunk novel Snow Crash, Neal Stephenson plunges the reader into a not-too-distant future. It is a world where the Mafia controls pizza delivery, the United States exists as a patchwork of corporate-franchise city-states, and the Internet--incarnate as the Metaverse--looks something like last year's hype would lead you to believe it should. Enter Hiro Protagonist--hacker, samurai swordsman, and pizza-delivery driver. When his best friend fries his brain on a new designer drug called Snow Crash and his beautiful, brainy ex-girlfriend asks for his help, what's a guy with a name like that to do? He rushes to the rescue. A breakneck-paced 21st-century novel, Snow Crash interweaves everything from Sumerian myth to visions of a postmodern civilization on the brink of collapse. Faster than the speed of television and a whole lot more fun, Snow Crash is the portrayal of a future that is bizarre enough to be plausible.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Neal Stephenson\Snow Crash (4676)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:59:14+02:00","epub","9780140232929","4676","isbn:9780140232929","","Calibre Library","2010-02-01T02:00:00+02:00","Gardners Books","4","","1.0","443252","Science fiction, General, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction, Fantasy","Snow Crash","Snow Crash","55ec8524-8189-40f7-a88c-4319d8dbaefc"

"Unknown","Ayn Rand","The revolutionary literary vision that sowed the seeds of Objectivism, Ayn Rand's groundbreaking philosophy, and brought her immediate worldwide acclaim.
This modern classic is the story of intransigent young architect Howard Roark, whose integrity was as unyielding as granite...of Dominique Francon, the exquisitely beautiful woman who loved Roark passionately, but married his worst enemy...and of the fanatic denunciation unleashed by an enraged society against a great creator. As fresh today as it was then, Rand’s provocative novel presents one of the most challenging ideas in all of fiction—that man’s ego is the fountainhead of human progress...“A writer of great power. She has a subtle and ingenious mind and the capacity of writing brilliantly, beautifully, bitterly...This is the only novel of ideas written by an American woman that I can recall.”—The New York Times

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: In 1978, science fiction writer Spider Robinson wrote a scathing review of The Stand in which he exhorted his readers to grab strangers in bookstores and beg them not to buy it. The Stand is like that. You either love it or hate it, but you can't ignore it. Stephen King's most popular book, according to polls of his fans, is an end-of-the-world scenario: a rapidly mutating flu virus is accidentally released from a U.S. military facility and wipes out 99 and 44/100 percent of the world's population, thus setting the stage for an apocalyptic confrontation between Good and Evil. ""I love to burn things up,"" King says. ""It's the werewolf in me, I guess.... The Stand was particularly fulfilling, because there I got a chance to scrub the whole human race, and man, it was fun! ... Much of the compulsive, driven feeling I had while I worked on The Stand came from the vicarious thrill of imagining an entire entrenched social order destroyed in one stroke."" There is much to admire in The Stand: the vivid thumbnail sketches with which King populates a whole landscape with dozens of believable characters; the deep sense of nostalgia for things left behind; the way it subverts our sense of reality by showing us a world we find familiar, then flipping it over to reveal the darkness underneath. Anyone who wants to know, or claims to know, the heart of the American experience needs to read this book. --Fiona Webster","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\The Stand (4697)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:59:32+02:00","epub","9780450537370","4697","isbn:9780450537370","","Calibre Library","2010-05-18T01:00:00+02:00","Hodder & Stoughton","4","","1.0","2331020","General, Fiction, Horror, Fiction - General, Horror & ghost stories, Classic fiction","The Stand","Stand, The","a61dd5c9-bd68-48cc-b9c6-9e388fc340ad"

I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HERE...."" -- DELBERT GRADY OF THE OVERLOOK HOTEL THE SHINING First published in 1977, The Shining quickly became a benchmark in the literary career of Stephen King. This tale of a troubled man hired to care for a remote mountain resort over the winter, his loyal wife, and their uniquely gifted son slowly but steadily unfolds as secrets from the Overlook Hotel's past are revealed, and the hotel itself attempts to laim the very souls of the Torrence family. Adapted into a cinematic masterpiece of horror by legendaryStanley Kubrick -- featuring an unforgettable performance by a demonic Jack Nicholson --The Shining stands as a cultural icon of modern horror, a searing study of a family torn apart, and a nightmarish glimpse into the dark recesses of human weakness and dementia.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\The Shining (4701)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:59:33+02:00","epub","9780451150325","4701","isbn:9780451150325","","Calibre Library","2010-05-18T01:00:00+02:00","Signet","4","","1.0","409465","General, Fiction, Horror, Horror & ghost stories, Fiction - Horror","The Shining","Shining, The","45479c2f-b515-4f52-984c-b7f1f00f6bed"
"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: When Stephen King originally wrote The Green Mile as a series of six novellas, he didn't even know how the story would turn out. And it turned out to be of his finest yarns, tapping into what he does best: character-driven storytelling. The setting is the small ""death house"" of a Southern prison in 1932. The Green Mile is the hall with a floor ""the color of tired old limes"" that leads to ""Old Sparky"" (the electric chair). The charming narrator is an old man, a prison guard, looking back on the events decades later. Maybe it's a little too cute (there's a smart prison mouse named Mr. Jingles), maybe the pathos is laid on a little thick, but it's hard to resist the colorful personalities and simple wonders of this supernatural tale. And it's not a bad choice for giving to someone who doesn't understand the appeal of Stephen King, because the one scene that is out-and-out gruesome (it involves ""Old Sparky"") can be easily skipped by the squeamish. The Green Mile won a 1997 Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel; and Tom Hanks stars in a film of the novel by Frank Darabont, the director of The Shawshank Redemption (from King's collection Different Seasons). --Fiona Webster","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\The Green Mile (4702)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:59:33+02:00","epub","9780671032654","4702","isbn:9780671032654","","Calibre Library","1999-03-15T02:00:00+02:00","Pocket","4","","1.0","327048","General, Fiction, Media Tie-In - General, Media Tie-In, Occult, Horror, Fiction - General, Horror & ghost stories, Horror tales, Georgia, Prisons, Death row inmates","The Green Mile","Green Mile, The","0aab6759-064d-43b9-b9dc-f2bb3a1e5cc6"

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: In Misery (1987), as in The Shining (1977), a writer is trapped in an evil house during a Colorado winter. Each novel bristles with claustrophobia, stinging insects, and the threat of a lethal explosion. Each is about a writer faced with the dominating monster of his unpredictable muse. Paul Sheldon, the hero of Misery, sees himself as a caged parrot who must return to Africa in order to be free. Thus, in the novel within a novel, the romance novel that his mad captor-nurse, Annie Wilkes, forces him to write, he goes to Africa--a mysterious continent that evokes for him the frightening, implacable solidity of a woman's (Annie's) body. The manuscript fragments he produces tell of a great Bee Goddess, an African queen reminiscent of H. Rider Haggard's She. He hates her, he fears her, he wants to kill her; but all the same he needs her power. Annie Wilkes literally breathes life into him. Misery touches on several large themes: the state of possession by an evil being, the idea that art is an act in which the artist willingly becomes captive, the tortured condition of being a writer, and the fears attendant to becoming a ""brand-name"" bestselling author with legions of zealous fans. And yet it's a tight, highly resonant echo chamber of a book--one of King's shortest, and best novels ever. --Fiona Webster","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\Misery (4704)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:59:34+02:00","epub","9788401491023","4704","isbn:9788401491023","","Calibre Library","2010-05-18T01:00:00+02:00","Distribooks Inc","4","","1.0","578332","General, Fiction - General, Horror - General, Spanish: Adult Fiction, Untranslated Fiction - Spanish","Misery","Misery","394dff34-001a-4f3d-b855-be5a1e1a8cff"

"King, Stephen","Stephen King","SUMMARY: Cujo is so well-paced and scary that people tend to read it quickly, so they mostly remember the scene of the mother and son trapped in the hot Pinto and threatened by the rabid Cujo, forgetting the multifaceted story in which that scene is embedded. This is definitely a novel that rewards re-reading. When you read it again, you can pay more attention to the theme of country folk vs. city folk; the parallel marriage conflicts of the Cambers vs. the Trentons; the poignancy of the amiable St. Bernard (yes, the breed choice is just right) infected by a brain-destroying virus that makes it into a monster; and the way the ""daylight burial"" of the failed ad campaign is reflected in the sunlit Pinto that becomes a coffin. And how significant it is that this horror tale is not supernatural: it's as real as junk food, a failing marriage, a broken-down car, or a fatal virus.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Stephen King\Cujo (4706)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:59:34+02:00","epub","9780451126504","4706","isbn:9780451126504","","Calibre Library","2010-05-18T01:00:00+02:00","Signet","4","","1.0","295538","General, Fiction, Modern & contemporary fiction (post c 1945)","Cujo","Cujo","e519e6f7-5f36-4355-b094-534217ff322b"

Through the most efficient scientific and psychological engineering, people are genetically designed to be passive and therefore consistently useful to the ruling class. This powerful work of speculative fiction sheds a blazing critical light on the present and is considered to be Aldous Huxley's most enduring masterpiece. The nonfiction work Brave New World Revisited, first published in 1958, is a fascinating work in which Huxley uses his tremendous knowledge of human relations to compare the modern-day world with his prophetic fantasy envisioned in Brave New World, including the threats to humanity, such as overpopulation, propaganda, and chemical persuasion.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Aldous Huxley\Brave new world (4708)\cover.jpg","2025-06-01T00:59:35+02:00","epub","9780060535261","4708","isbn:9780060535261","","Calibre Library","2004-06-15T01:00:00+02:00","HarperCollins","4","","1.0","223701","Science fiction, General, Fiction, Classics, English fiction, Romance, Criticism, Literary Criticism, Literature - Classics, Literary, Science, History, English; Irish; Scottish; Welsh, European, Genetic engineering, Psychological, Psychological fiction, Literature: Classics, Dystopias, Political, Political fiction, Genetics & Genomics, Life Sciences, Civilization, Passivity (Psychology), Huxley; Aldous; 1894-1963, Business & Economics, Collectivism, Sales & Selling, Totalitarianism","Brave new world","Brave new world","791fe3e5-7f98-40b6-95d5-83be0309e2a9"

"Dick, Philip K.","Philip K. Dick","SUMMARY: ""The most consistently brilliant science fiction writer in the world.""--John BrunnerTHE INSPIRATION FOR BLADERUNNER. . . Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was published in 1968. Grim and foreboding, even today it is a masterpiece ahead of its time.By 2021, the World War had killed millions, driving entire species into extinction and sending mankind off-planet. Those who remained coveted any living creature, and for people who couldn't afford one, companies built incredibly realistic simulacrae: horses, birds, cats, sheep. . . They even built humans.Emigrees to Mars received androids so sophisticated it was impossible to tell them from true men or women. Fearful of the havoc these artificial humans could wreak, the government banned them from Earth. But when androids didn't want to be identified, they just blended in. Rick Deckard was an officially sanctioned bounty hunter whose job was to find rogue androids, and to retire them.

"Dick, Philip K.","Philip K. Dick","EDITORIAL REVIEW:  Philip K. Dick was born in Chicago in 1928 and lived most of his life in California. The author of thirty-six novels, including the acclaimed *Blade Runner*, and five short story collections, he won a Hugo Award for *The Man in the High Castle,* and a John W. Campbell Memorial Award *for Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said.* He died in 1982.In the world of *The Minority Report, *Commissioner John Anderton is the one to thank for the lack of crime. He is the originator of the Precrime System, which uses ""precogs""–people with the power to see into the future–to identify criminals before they can do any harm. Unfortunately for Anderton, his precogs perceive *him *as the next criminal. But Anderton knows he has never contemplated such a thing, and this knowledge proves the precogs are fallible. Now, whichever way he turns, Anderton is doomed–unless he can find the precogs's ""minority report""–the dissenting voice that represents his one hope of getting at the truth in time to save himself from his own system.A film version of *The Minority Report*, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise, will be released this summer–further proof of the enduring appeal of Philip K. Dick's visionary fiction.","C:\Users\smoreau\Calibre Library\Philip K.

"Unknown","Iain Banks","Iain M. Banks, the international bestselling author of The Player of Games and Consider Phlebas, is a true original, a literary visionary whose brilliant speculative fiction has transported us into worlds of unbounded imagination. Now, in his acclaimed new novel, Banks presents an engrossing portrait of an alien world, and of two very different people bound by a startling and mysterious secret.
On a backward world with six moons, an alert spy reports on the doings of one Dr. Vosill, who has mysteriously become the personal physician to the king despite being a foreigner and, even more unthinkably, a woman. Vosill has more enemies than she first realizes. But then she also has more remedies in hand than those who wish her ill can ever guess. Elsewhere, in another palace across the mountains, a man named DeWar serves as chief bodyguard to the Protector General of Tassasen, a profession he describes as the business of ""assassinating assassins.
"" DeWar, too, has his enemies, but his foes strike more swiftly, and his means of combating them are more direct. No one trusts the doctor, and the bodyguard trusts no one, but is there a hidden commonality linking their disparate histories? Spiraling around a central core of mystery, deceit, love, and betrayal. Inversions is a dazzling work of science fiction from a versatile and imaginative author writing at the height of his remarkable powers.

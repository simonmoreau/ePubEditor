    "Description": "SUMMARY:\na selection from CHAPTER ONE: On the ground, new blades of grass sprang up in chlorophyll coats. On the trees, tongues of green protruded from boughs and branches, wrapping them about - soon the place would look like an imbecile Earthchild\u0027s attempt to draw Christmas trees - as spring again set spur to the growing things in the southern hemisphere of Dapdrof. Not that nature was more amiable on Dapdrof than elsewhere. Even as she sent the warmer winds over the southern hemisphere, she was sousing most of the northern in an ice-bearing monsoon. Propped on G-crutches, old Aylmer Ainson stood at his door, scratching his scalp very leisurely and staring at the budding trees. Even the slenderest outmost twig shook very little, for all that a stiffish breeze blew. This leaden effect was caused by gravity; twigs, like everything else on Dapdrof. weighed three times as much as they did on Earth. Ainson was long accustomed to the phenomenon. His body had grown round-shouldered and hollow-chested accustoming him to it. His brain had grown a little round-shouldered in the process. Fortunately he was not afflicted with the craving to recapture the past that strikes down so many humans even before they reach middle age. The sight of infant green leaves woke in him only the vaguest nostalgia, roused in him only the faintest recollection that his childhood had been passed among foliage more responsive to April\u0027s zephyrs - zephyrs, moreover, a hundred light years away. He was free to stand in the doorway and enjoy man\u0027s richest luxury, a blank mind. Idly, he watched Quequo. the female utod, as she trod between her salad beds and under the ammp trees to launch her body into the bolstering mud. The ammp trees were evergreen, unlike the rest of the trees in Ainson\u0027s enclosure. Resting in the foliage on the crest of them were big four-winged white birds, which decided to take off as Ainson looked at them, fluttering up like immense butterflies and splashing their shadows across the house as they passed. But the house was already splashed with their shadows. Obeying the urge to create a work of art that visited them perhaps only once in a century, Ainson\u0027s friends had broken the white of his walls with a scatterbrained scattering of silhouetted wings and bodies, urging upwards. The lively movement of this pattern seemed to make the low-eaved house rise against gravity; but that was appearance only, for this spring found the neoplastic rooftree sagging and the supporting walls considerably buckled at the knees. This was the fortieth spring Ainson had seen flow across his patch of Dapdrof. Even the ripe stench from the mid-denstead now savoured only of home. As he breathed it in, his grorg or parasite-eater scratched his head for him; reaching up, Ainson returned the compliment and tickled the lizard-like creature\u0027s cranium. He guessed what the grorg really wanted, but at that hour, with only one of the suns up, it was too chilly to join Snok Snok Karn and Quequo Kifful with their grorgs for a wallow in the mire. \u0022I\u0027m cold standing out here. I am going inside to lie down,\u0022 he called to Snok Snok in the utodian tongue. The young utod looked up and extended two of his limbs in a sign of understanding. That was gratifying. Even after forty years* study, Ainson found the utodian language full of conundrums. He had not been sure that he had not said. \u0022The stream is cold and I am going inside to cook it.\u0022 Catching the right whistling inflected scream was not easy: he had only one sound orifice to Snok Snok\u0027s eight. He swung his crutches and went in. \u0022His speech is growing less distinct than it was,\u0022 Quequo remarked. \u0022We had difficulty enough teaching him to communicate. He is not an efficient mechanism, this manlegs. You may have noticed that he is moving more slowly than he did.\u0022",

An epic saga of love and war, crime and politics, religion and revolution, this magnificent novel is a fitting conclusion to a great science fiction trilogy ... and an invaluable addition to the thrilling world of Frank Herbert\u2019s immortal **Dune**.**Dune: House Corrino**Fearful of losing his precarious hold on the Golden Lion Throne, Shaddam IV, Emperor of a Million Worlds, has devised a radical scheme to develop an alternative to melange, the addictive spice that binds the Imperium together and that can be found only on the desert world of Dune. In subterranean labs on the machine planet Ix, cruel Tleilaxu overlords use slaves and prisoners as part of a horrific plan to manufacture a synthetic form of melange known as amal. If amal can supplant the spice from Dune, it will give Shaddam what he seeks: absolute power.But Duke Leto Atreides, grief-stricken yet unbowed by the tragic death of his son Victor, determined to restore the honor and prestige of his House, has his own plans for Ix. He will free the Ixians from their oppressive conquerors and restore his friend Prince Rhombur, injured scion of the disgraced House Vernius, to his rightful place as Ixian ruler. It is a bold and risky venture, for House Atreides has limited military resources and many ruthless enemies, including the sadistic Baron Harkonnen, despotic master of Dune. Meanwhile, Duke Leto\u2019s consort, the beautiful Lady Jessica, obeying the orders of her superiors in the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, has conceived a child that the Sisterhood intends to be the penultimate step in the creation of an all-powerful being. Yet what the Sisterhood doesn\u2019t know is that the child Jessica is carrying is not the girl they are expecting, but a boy. Jessica\u2019s act of disobedience is an act of love \u2014 her attempt to provide her Duke with a male heir to House Atreides \u2014 but an act that, when discovered, could kill both mother and baby. Like the Bene Gesserit, Shaddam Corrino is also concerned with making a plan for the future \u2014 securing his legacy. Blinded by his need for power, the Emperor will launch a plot against Dune, the only natural source of true spice. If he succeeds, his madness will result in a cataclysmic tragedy not even he foresees: the end of space travel, the Imperium, and civilization itself.With Duke Leto and other renegades and revolutionaries fighting to stem the tide of darkness that threatens to engulf their universe, the stage is set for a showdown unlike any seen before.\n\n",

Dune: House Harkonnen At last Shaddam sits on the Golden Lion Throne, his precarious position as ruler of the Known Universe dependent on producing a male heir. But his leadership is further threatened by the ambitious Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, whose insatiable thirst for dominance leads him to plot against some of t he most powerful forced in the Imperium, hoping to elevate his own ruthless House to unprecedented heights of power. His primary targets: House Atreides and the mysterious Bene Gasserit Sisterhood. The Sisterhood are unaware of this threat as they prepare to culminate the work of centuries in the creation of a god-child who will sweep away emperors, houses, and history itself in a terrifying new order of religious tyranny. The desert world Dune, the machine world IX, and countless other conquered planets groan under the numbing slavery of cruel new masters determined to exploit their resources - most notably the addictive spice melange found only on Dune. But small bands of renegades begin to fight back, lighting the spark of freedom against overwhelming odds. New, unexpected heroes arise: young and resourceful Liet-Kynes on Dune, wily and patient C\u0027tair on IX, and the unyielding Gurney Halleck in Giedi Prime, driven to vengeance against his Harkonnen overlords. For Leto Atreides, grown complacent and comfortable as ruler of his House, it is time of momentous choice: between love and honor, friendship and duty, safety and destiny. Leto has finally produced an heir to House Atreides, Victor, and will make whatever choices necessary to protect the young boy and ensure his legacy as Duke. Ultimately, however, for House Atreides there is just one choice - strive for greatness or crushed.",

When one of Erebus\u0101s wormships kills millions on the world of Klurhammon, a high-tech agricultural world of no real tactical significance, agent Ian Cormac is sent to investigate, though he is secretly struggling to control a new ability no human being should possess . . . and beginning to question the motives of his AI masters. Further attacks and seemingly indiscriminate slaughter ensue, but only serve to bring some of the most dangerous individuals in the Polity into the war. Mr Crane, the indefatigable brass killing machine sets out for vengeance, while Orlandine, a vastly-augmented haiman who herself controls Jain technology, seeks a weapon of appalling power and finds allies from an ancient war. Meanwhile Mika, scientist and Dragon expert, is again kidnapped by that unfathomable alien entity and dragged into the heart of things: to wake the makers of Jain technology from their five-million-year slumber. But Erebus\u0101s attacks are not so indiscriminate, after all, and could very well herald the end of the Polity itself . . .",

This practical book shows you how true data-drivenness involves processes that require genuine buy-in across your company, from analysts and management to the C-Suite and the board. Through interviews and examples from data scientists and analytics leaders in a variety of industries, author Carl Anderson explains the analytics value chain you need to adopt when building predictive business models\u2014from data collection and analysis to the insights and leadership that drive concrete actions.",

Sent out on a titanic Polity dreadnought, the Occam Razor, agent Cormac must investigate the disaster. Meanwhile, on the remote planet Masada, the long-term rebellion can never rise above-ground, as the slave population is subjugated by orbital laser arrays controlled by the Theocracy in their cylinder worlds, and by the fact that they cannot safely leave their labour compounds. For the wilderness of Masada lacks breathable air ... and out there roam monstrous predators called hooders and siluroynes, not to mention the weird and terrible gabbleducks.",

A woman with feline genes, bred for sex slavery. A man who kills to protect his pet. Two truckers who don?t care about laws designed for the cities. All are on the run across a surreal landscape where their odyssey takes them into the dangerous wilds, along roads and highways rapidly becoming impassable, and into cities where they have to live as outlaws. There is a chance for them to find a normal life if they can survive long enough to be accepted as immigrants to the moon. But only two of them can go, and only if they aren?t caught first. Altered Humans is a novel set in the days before the pet plague reaches its peak, where society is in flux, where survival is for the strong, but where goodness and generosity can still be found?if you don?t die first.",

Under cover as a factory manager, Anderson combs Bangkok\u0027s street markets in search of foodstuffs thought to be extinct, hoping to reap the bounty of history\u0027s lost calories. There, he encounters Emiko. Emiko is the Windup Girl, a strange and beautiful creature. One of the New People, Emiko is not human; instead, she is an engineered being, creche-grown and programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of a Kyoto businessman, but now abandoned to the streets of Bangkok. Regarded as soulless beings by some, devils by others, New People are slaves, soldiers, and toys of the rich in a chilling near future in which calorie companies rule the world, the oil age has passed, and the side effects of bio-engineered plagues run rampant across the globe. What Happens when calories become currency? What happens when bio-terrorism becomes a tool for corporate profits, when said bio-terrorism\u0027s genetic drift forces mankind to the cusp of post-human evolution?

Ballard was one of the first British writers of the post-War period to begin to see, and to map out in his fiction, the future course of our civilization. For forty years his unflinching eye has turned to the point where the advancing edge of our technological progress has worn away our inner humanity. Eden-Olympia is more than just a multinational business park, it is a virtual city-state in itself, with the latest in services and facilities for the most elite high-tech industries. Isolated and secure, overlooking the luxurious French Riviera, the residents lack nothing. Yet one day Doctor Greenwood from Eden-Olympia\u0027s clinic goes on a suicidal shooting spree. Dr. Jane Sinclair is hired as his replacement, and she and her husband Paul are given Dr. Greenwood\u0027s house as a residence.Unable to work while recovering from an accident, Paul spends his days taking a close look at the house where Dr. Greenwood shot himself and three hostages. He discovers clues in the house lead him to question Eden-Olympia\u0027s official account of the killings. Drawn into investigating the activities of the park\u0027s leading citizens, while Jane is lured deeper into Eden-Olympia\u0027s inner workings, Paul uncovers the dangerous psychological vents that maintain Eden-Olympia\u0027s smoothly-running surface. An experiment is underway at Eden-Olympia, an experiment in power and brutality. Soon Paul finds himself in race to save himself and his wife before they\u0027re crushed by forces that may be beyond anyone\u0027s control.\n\n",

Abel and Morgan live in a forboding castle, alone and isolated, until the conflict intrudes on their numb lives in the form of a cruel mercenary lieutenant and her violent, ravaging men who take up residence. From there, the tale disintegrates into darkness and atrocity, punctuated by Abel\u0027s memories of earlier joy and pain. Iain Banks pushes the story steadily downward, dragging the morbidly fascinated reader into the depths of human despair. Gang rape, torture, and incest are seen through Abel\u0027s uncaring eyes--this book is not for the squeamish. And although Banks strives for a Passion play in the end, what\u0027s missing is even the tiniest kernel of real redemption. Fans of The Wasp Factory and Banks\u0027s other non-science fiction works will find familiar details here, but A Song of Stone stands alone as a fable of hopelessness. --Therese Littleton",

It has space battle cruisers, a glowing court--all the stuff of good old science fiction--which appears old-fashioned in contrast to Gurgeh\u0027s home. At first it\u0027s a relief, but further exploration reveals the empire to be depraved and terrifically unjust. Its defects are gross exaggerations of our own, yet they indict us all the same. Clearly Banks is interested in the idea of a future where everyone can be mature and happy. Yet it\u0027s interesting to note that in order to give us this compelling adventure story, he has to return to a more traditional setting. Thoughtful science fiction readers will appreciate the cultural comparisons, and fans of big ideas and action will also be rewarded. --Brooks Peck\u003C/p\u003E",

Moons, planets, the very stars themselves, faced destruction, cold-blooded, brutal, and worse, random. The Idirans fought for their Faith; the Culture for its moral right to exist. Principles were at stake. There could be no surrender. Within the cosmic conflict, an individual crusade. Deep within a fabled labyrinth on a barren world, a Planet of the Dead proscribed to mortals, lay a fugitive Mind. Both the Culture and the Idirans sought it. It was the fate of Horza, the Changer, and his motley crew of unpredictable mercenaries, human and machine, actually to find it, and with it their own destruction. Consider Phlebas - a space opera of stunning power and awesome imagination.",

Banks, the international bestselling author of The Player of Games and Consider Phlebas, is a true original, a literary visionary whose brilliant speculative fiction has transported us into worlds of unbounded imagination. Now, in his acclaimed new novel, Banks presents an engrossing portrait of an alien world, and of two very different people bound by a startling and mysterious secret. On a backward world with six moons, an alert spy reports on the doings of one Dr. Vosill, who has mysteriously become the personal physician to the king despite being a foreigner and, even more unthinkably, a woman. Vosill has more enemies than she first realizes. But then she also has more remedies in hand than those who wish her ill can ever guess. Elsewhere, in another palace across the mountains, a man named DeWar serves as chief bodyguard to the Protector General of Tassasen, a profession he describes as the business of \u0022assassinating assassins.\u0022 DeWar, too, has his enemies, but his foes strike more swiftly, and his means of combating them are more direct. No one trusts the doctor, and the bodyguard trusts no one, but is there a hidden commonality linking their disparate histories? Spiraling around a central core of mystery, deceit, love, and betrayal. Inversions is a dazzling work of science fiction from a versatile and imaginative author writing at the height of his remarkable powers.\u003C/p\u003E",

For one man it means a desperate flight, and a search for the one - maybe two - people who could clear his name. For his brother it means a life lived under constant threat of treachery and murder. And for their sister, it means returning to a place she\u0027d thought abandoned forever.Only the sister is not what she once was; Djan Seriy Anaplian has become an agent of the Culture\u0027s Special Circumstances section, charged with high-level interference in civilisations throughout the greater galaxy.Concealing her new identity - and her particular set of abilities - might be a dangerous strategy.

Prepared to risk everything for her freedom, her release, when it comes, is at a price, and to put things right she will need the help of the Culture.\nBenevolent, enlightened and almost infinitely resourceful though it may be, the Culture can only do so much for any individual. With the assistance of one of its most powerful - and arguably deranged - warships, Lededje finds herself heading into a combat zone not even sure which side the Culture is really on.  A war - brutal, far-reaching - is already raging within the digital realms that store the souls of the dead, and it\u0026#8217;s about to erupt into reality.\nIt started in the realm of the Real and that is where it will end.

But an alien space-going vessel -- unimaginably ancient yet astonishingly still operational -- has been left behind on the surface of one of Iris\u0027s oribiting satellites by a strange and unknown culture. And the extraordinary artifact is pointing the colonist toward an even more remarkable discovery awaiting them on Iris itself; something deadly, inconceivable....and alive.",

Now the rulers of Axis City have discovered that a huge group of colonists has secretly entered one of the interdicted worlds along the Way.

There are only a few of these \u0022ecos\u0022 on Lamarkia, and the effect of human interaction on them is unknown. Olmy Ap Sennon has been sent to secretly assess the extent of the damage. But he will find far more than an intriguing alien biology--for on their new world the secret colonists have returned to the old ways of human history: war, famine, and ecological disaster. On this mission, Olmy will learn about the basics: love, responsibility, and even failure...",

    "Description": "Two scientists, Sarah and Richard discover the existence of a living human ancestor, Homo floresiensis on an isolated tropical island. These small hobbit-like creatures are not the hobbits of JRR Tolkien\u0027s stories but a small tribe of prehistoric people called the Ebu Gogo living in seeming isolation for nearly a half million years on the Indonesian island of Irm\u00E3 Flores. In their unrelenting quest for knowledge, Sarah and Richard unintentionally expose these innocents to the onslaught of the modern world including corporate raiders, Indonesian pirates (sorry, no Johnny Depp types!) and religious zealots. Moreover, while struggling with the magnitude of their find, Sarah and Richard are forced to reconcile their own, very different personalities. In the process of discovery and befriending these ancient people, Sarah and Richard rediscover their own humanity and the opportunity to find true love.\n\nThe novel begins with Sarah finding herself clinging for life aboard a small boat that is being tossed about by a tempest in the Flores Sea. Sarah is an attractive young lady and a leading authority on the study of the great apes but she is questioning her own sanity for having taken this journey. This is one of many trips Sarah has made to assist her mentor but this trip takes wrong turn when the boat\u0027s engine dies and forcing her and her guides to seek shelter on a small, uncharted island in the Flores Sea. \n\nAs the guides repair the motor of their stranded boat, Sarah wanders off from the beach, heading to the woods to observe the local bird population. While she is sitting in the woods she suddenly feels as if she is being watched. Sarah is not easily scared, since she has spent many days alone in the wild while observing her beloved chimps and gorillas. But this experience is entirely different to her and she begins to feels a strange presence closing in about her. Then she actually hears the presence! Strange human-like voices, much like the mumbling\u0027s of the damned, begin to fill her ears coming from all directions. Sarah is terrified and paralyzed with fear as they begin to surround her. In the distance Sarah can hear the guides frantically searching for her but it is too late for rescue...\n\nWarning! This adventure/science fiction novel contains contemporary language, numerous naked Ebu Gogo, some sexual situations, depictions of drug use and humor that some might find to be a bit raw. Moreover, this is an adult book filled with violence and is definitely not recommended for young children. Also keep in mind, this book has a complete disdain for almost all authority figures. ",

He wrote radio scripts, screenplays, and comic books (in which capacity he created the original Green Lantern Oath). But Bester is best known for his science-fiction novels, and The Stars My Destination may be his finest creation. First published in 1956 (as Tiger! Tiger!), the novel revolves around a hero named Gulliver Foyle, who teleports himself out of a tight spot and creates a great deal of consternation in the process. With its sly potshotting at corporate skullduggery, The Stars My Destination seems utterly contemporary, and has maintained its status as an underground classic for forty years. (Bester fans should also note that Vintage has reprinted The Demolished Man, which won the very first Hugo Award in 1953.)",

Uneasy in the midst of the malevolent Unseelie Court, pixie Kaye is sure of only one thing -- her love for Roiben. But when Kaye, drunk on faerie wine, declares herself to Roiben, he sends her on a seemingly impossible quest. Now Kaye can\u0027t see or speak to Roiben unless she can find the one thing she knows doesn\u0027t exist: a faerie who can tell a lie. Miserable and convinced she belongs nowhere, Kaye decides to tell her mother the truth -- that she is a changeling left in place of the human daughter stolen long ago. Her mother\u0027s shock and horror sends Kaye back to the world of Faerie to find her human counterpart and return her to Ironside. But once back in the faerie courts, Kaye finds herself a pawn in the games of Silarial, queen of the Seelie Court. Silarial wants Roiben\u0027s throne, and she will use Kaye, and any means necessary, to get it. In this game of wits and weapons, can a pixie outplay a queen?Holly Black spins a seductive tale at once achingly real and chillingly enchanted, set in a dangerous world where pleasure mingles with pain and nothing is exactly as it appears.",

When the *Syracuse* stumbles into the middle of a military attack on the habitat *Chrysalis, *Victor flees in a control pod to draw the attacker\u2019s attention away from his family. Now, as his wife and children plunge into the far deeps of space, Victor has been rescued by the seductive Cheena Madagascar. He must do her bidding if he\u2019s to have a prayer of ever seeing his family again.\n\n \n\nElverda Apacheta is the solar system\u2019s greatest sculptor. The cyborg Dorn was formerly Dorik Harbin, the ruthless military commander responsible for the attack on *Chrysalis*. Their lives and destinies have been linked by their joint discovery of the alien artifact that had, earlier, profoundly affected industrialist Martin Humphries. Similarly transformed by the artifact\u2019s mysterious powers, Apacheta and Dorn now prowl the Belt, determined to find the bodies of the many victims of Harbin\u2019s atrocities so that they can be given proper burials.\n\n \n\nKao Yuan is the captain of *Viking*, owned by Martin Humphries, who\u2019s determined to kill Dorn and Elverda because they know too much about the artifact and its power over him. But *Viking*\u0027s second-in-command, Tamara Vishinsky, appears to have the real power on board ship. When *Viking* catches up to Apacheta and Dorn, their confrontation begins a series of events involving them, the Zacharius family, and Martin Humphries and his son in the transformation of the human solar system\u2026\n\n",

In a perfectly executed attack, all of the bridges and tunnels leading into and out of Manhattan are destroyed just as thousands of commuters begin their holiday exodus. With domestic efforts focused on search and rescue, a deadly team of highly trained foreign soldiers methodically makes its way through the city with the singular objective of locating one of their own -- a man so powerful that America will do anything to keep him hidden.Scot Harvath is now the country\u0027s only hope. Fighting his way through the burning streets of Manhattan, he must mount his own operation to locate a man the United States government refuses to admit even exists.",

Enchanted by its powerful rural magic\u2014and by a beautiful, enigmatic lady who bears the name of an Egyptian queen\u2014the writer sets out to uncover Summerton\u0027s mysteries before the inevitable arrival of a ruthless destruction.  \n\n With *Leviathan \u002799*, the author who once colonized Mars returns to the cosmos to brilliantly reimagine Herman Melville\u0027s classic masterwork of obsession and the sea, transforming a great whale into a worlds-devouring comet. In the year 2099, fledgling astronaut Ishmael Hunnicut Jones boards the *Cetus 7*, placing his fate in the hands of a relentless madman who is blindly chasing the celestial monster\u0027s tail. And in the merciless void, a crew of earthborn and alien star-travelers will face a divine judgment, and an \u0022enemy\u0022 wielding the most fearsome weapon of all . . . Time.  \n\n More than a half century into his remarkable career, Ray Bradbury continues to delight and astound with grand visions, lyrical prose, and provocative thought. Rich in poetry, wonder, imagination, and truth, here is proof positive that the words and stories of the inimitable Bradbury will live on . . . *Now and Forever*.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nThat The Illustrated Man has remained in print since being published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury\u0027s work. Only his second collection (the first was Dark Carnival, later reworked into The October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What\u0027s even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \u0022The Veldt,\u0022 wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \u0022Kaleidoscope,\u0022 a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \u0022Zero Hour,\u0022 in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. --Stanley Wiater",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nMan, was a a distant shore, and the men spread upon it in wave... Each wave different, and each wave stronger. The Martian ChroniclesRay Bradbury is a storyteller without peer, a poet of the possible, and, indisputably, one of America\u0027s most beloved authors. In a much celebrated literary career that has spanned six decades, he has produced an astonishing body of work: unforgettable novels, including Fahrenheit 451 and Something Wicked This Way Comes; essays, theatrical works, screenplays and teleplays; The Illustrated Mein, Dandelion Wine, The October Country, and numerous other superb short story collections. But of all the dazzling stars in the vast Bradbury universe, none shines more luminous than these masterful chronicles of Earth\u0027s settlement of the fourth world from the sun. Bradbury\u0027s Mars is a place of hope, dreams and metaphor-of crystal pillars and fossil seas-where a fine dust settles on the great, empty cities of a silently destroyed civilization. It is here the invaders have come to despoil and commercialize, to grow and to learn -first a trickle, then a torrent, rushing from a world with no future toward a promise of tomorrow. The Earthman conquers Mars ... and then is conquered by it, lulled by dangerous lies of comfort and familiarity, and enchanted by the lingering glamour of an ancient, mysterious native race. Ray Bradbury\u0027s The Martian Chronicles is a classic work of twentieth-century literature whose extraordinary power and imagination remain undimmed by time\u0027s passage. In connected, chronological stories, a true grandmaster once again enthralls, delights and challenges us with his vision and his heart-starkly and stunningly exposing in brilliant spacelight our strength, our weakness, our folly, and our poignant humanity on a strange and breathtaking world where humanity does not belong.",

It is a peaceful reign, held by compact and not by conquest. Again and again, when rebellion threatens the Terran Peace, the natives of the rebellious world have turned against their own people and sided with the men of Terra; not from fear, but from a sense of dedication.  \n\nThere has never been open war. The battle for these worlds is fought in the minds of a few men who stand between worlds; bound to one world by interest, loyalties and allegiance; bound to the other by love.  \n\nSuch a world is Wolf. Such a man was Race Cargill of the Terran Secret Service. . . .  \n\nAt one time Race Cargill had been the best Terran Intelligence agent on the complex and mysterious planet of Wolf. He had repeatedly imperiled his life amongst the half-human and non-human creatures of the sullen world. And he had repeatedly accomplished the fantastic missions until his name was emblazoned with glory.  \n\nBut that had all seemingly ended. For six long years he\u0027d sat behind a boring desk inside the fenced-in Terran Headquarters, cut off there ever since he and a rival had scarred and ripped each other in blood-feud.  \n\nBut when *The Door Through Space* swung suddenly open, the feud was on again -- and with it a plot designed to check and destroy the Terran Empire.\n\n",

He was so bored with his own company that the Mentorian medic was a welcome sight when he came to prepare him for *cold-sleep*.  \n\nThe Mentorian paused, needle in hand. \u0022Do you wish to be wakened for the time we shall spend in each of the three star systems, sir? You can, of course, be given enough drug to keep you in cold-sleep until we reach your destination.\u0022  \n\nBart felt tempted -- he wanted very much to see the other star systems. But he couldn\u0027t risk meeting other passengers.  \n\nThe needle went into his arm. In sudden panic, he realized he was helpless. The ship would touch down on three worlds, and on any of them the Lhari might have his description, or his alias! He could be taken off, unconscious, and might never wake up! He tried to move, to protest, but he couldn\u0027t. There was a freezing moment of intense cold and then nothing. . . .  \n\n*  \n\nMarion Zimmer Bradley was born in Albany, New York and before she started her writing career she was a file clerk, music teacher, and a carnival performer.

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nElixir is a novel poised, sometimes awkwardly, between the demands of philosophical speculation and those of hang-on-to-your-hats suspense. Gary Braver\u0027s biotech thriller takes as its premise the existence of a fountain of youth: when Chris Bacon, a dedicated medicinal chemist for Darby Pharmaceuticals, journeys to Papua, New Guinea, in search of \u0022miracle drugs that grow on trees,\u0022 he finds much more than the contraceptive plant steroids he was looking for. He discovers tabukari, the \u0022forbidden flower of the long day\u0022--a blossom with the power to prolong life. When his bosses, and other powerful and unsavory characters, discover that Chris has successfully synthesized a formula for immortality, the scientist and his family become the targets of a ruthless manhunt. What the bad guys don\u0027t know is that Chris didn\u0027t stop at injecting lab rats with his elixir; he is himself participating in a dangerous experiment. Braver effectively conveys both Chris\u0027s burning desire to test the fruits of his labor, and his wife\u0027s prophetic understanding that those fruits are far more lethal than anything Eve might have given Adam: They were silent for a long spell, and Laura felt the old anger burn itself through the sadness. Chris had brought this upon them himself. In a monumentally stupid act he had injected the stuff into his veins thirteen years ago and forever infected the very fabric of their lives. While she understood all the forces that had driven him to that act, she could never forgive him. More than anyone else alive he was able to foresee the consequences but had chosen to disregard them instead. And while she felt pity and compassion for him, there were moments she hated him for what he had done. In addition to metaphysical speculations on the social consequences of living forever, biotech thrillers demand action, suspense, car chases, villains, breathless pursuits, guns, meaningful glances--you name it, Braver provides it, and it\u0027s an unholy mess at times. His sense of plot is shaky, and the novel falters whenever it moves away from Chris and his family (and even they can become a bit tedious). But Elixir is more successful than the sum of these parts would seem to allow; in taking on the power of research and genetic manipulation, Braver has plugged into a hot topic, and he largely does it justice. --Kelly Flynn",

What happens after that? Will the descendants of today\u0027s humanity become gods or demons, or simply destroy themselves? And will we be among their number, carried along by rejuvenation and immortality treatments? For Natalie and her irritatingly beautiful young sister Suzanna, these are no longer abstract questions.

What the hell is he building out there in the garage? When Hugh frog-marches his family into the garage, it looks as if he\u0027s really gone mad, and they\u0027re due to perish even before the plague wipes out all life on earth.

With the Oval Office in the balance, the President dispatches White House Intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton to the Milne Ice Shelf to verify the authenticity of the find. Accompanied by a team of experts, including the charismatic academic Michael Tolland, Rachel uncovers the unthinkable: evidence of scientific trickery -- a bold deception that threatens to plunge the world into controversy.  \n\n But before Rachel can contact the President, she and Michael are attacked by a deadly team of assassins controlled by a mysterious power broker who will stop at nothing to hide the truth. Fleeing for their lives in an environment as desolate as it is lethal, their only hope for survival is to find out who is behind this masterful ploy. The truth, they will learn, is the most shocking deception of all.  \n\n In *Deception Point,* bestselling author Dan Brown transports readers from the ultrasecret National Reconnaissance Office to the towering ice shelves of the Arctic Circle, and back again to the hallways of power inside the West Wing. Heralded for masterfully intermingling science, history, and politics in his critically acclaimed, blockbuster thrillers *Angels \u0026 Demons* and *The Da Vinci Code,* Brown has crafted a novel in which nothing is as it seems -- and behind every corner is a stunning surprise. *Deception Point* is pulse-pounding fiction at its best.",

And now, The Gypsy Morph rounds out\u2013with an adventure of unforgettably imaginative scope\u2013the first phase of a new chapter in this classic series.Eighty years into the future, the United States is a no-man\u2019s-land: its landscape blighted by chemical warfare, pollution, and plague; its government collapsed; its citizens adrift, desperate, fighting to stay alive. In fortified compounds, survivors hold the line against wandering predators, rogue militias, and hideous mutations spawned from the toxic environment, while against them all stands an enemy neither mortal nor merciful: demons and their minions bent on slaughtering and subjugating the last of humankind.But from around the country, allies of good unite to challenge the rampaging evil. Logan Tom, wielding the magic staff of a Knight of the Word, has a promise to keep\u2013protecting the world\u2019s only hope of salvation\u2013and a score to settle with the demon that massacred his family. Angel Perez, Logan\u2019s fellow Knight, has risked her life to aid the elvish race, whose peaceful, hidden realm is marked for extermination by the forces of the Void. Kirisin Belloruus, a young elf entrusted with an ancient magic, must deliver his entire civilization from a monstrous army. And Hawk, the rootless boy who is nothing less than destiny\u2019s instrument, must lead the last of humanity to a latter-day promised land before the final darkness falls. The Gypsy Morph is an epic saga of a world in flux as the mortal realm yields to a magical one; as the champions of the Word and the Void clash for the last time to decide what will be and what must cease; and as, from the remnants of a doomed age, something altogether extraordinary rises.",

Not only has he been sent out from Liquid Space to overhaul a stinking little backwater universe, he\u0027s also been tasked by his master (the large and extremely hungry Praetor Primus) to track down his old supervisor Gharfos Nyl. Why in all the hells would a being like Technician Nyl vanish right now, when thousands of alien races have been trying to vaporize him for centuries to no avail? And what could he possibly see in a two-bit mudball called the Earth, a radioactive ruin whose last city totters on the brink of disaster, riven from within by plutocrats, druglords, inbred aristocrats and a faltering A.I. overmind? He\u0027s being paid to find out... the only question is, will that paycheck be enough? Elysian Fields is an all-action pulp sci-fi adventure packed with all the violence, destruction and alien terror you can put down on paper. Just like a comic book, only crunchy!",

Now his adopted world, Lusitania, is threatened by the same planet-destroying weapon that he himself used so many thousands of years before. Lusitania is home to three sentient species: The Pequeninos, a strange race native to Lusitania; a large colony of humans; and the Hive Queen, brought there by Ender. But the Starways Congress fears Lusitania and a strange virus that it harbors, and they have gathered a fleet to destroy the planet. Ender\u0027s oldest friend, Jane, the computer intelligence that has evolved with him over three thousand years, allowed the Starways Congress to discover her existence when she tried t stop the fleet. Now they are trying to kill her as well, by shutting down the network of computers and ansibles in which she lives. They are afraid of her and of her control over all human communications. Jane can save the three sentient races of Lusitania. She has learned how to move ships outside the universe, and then instantly back to a different world, abolishing the light-speed limit. But it takes all the processing power available to her, and the Starways Congress is shutting down the Net world by world. Soon she will not be able to move the ships. But there is hope: during the first trip outside, Ender\u0027s mind briefly took control and created two new beings - replicas of his brother Peter, who was the Hegemon, and his sister Valentine. These two children of Ender\u0027s mind, together with his adopted children from Lusitania, are racing against time to discover new worlds, to influence the Starways Congress to recall the fleet, and to save Jane by finding a home for her disembodied intelligence once the Human Network is closed off to her.\nEDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nNow in trade paperback for the first time!With Children of the Mind, Card returns to the story of Ender Wiggin: hero of the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Enders Game, the original Speaker for the Dead, and the hated Xenocide who murdered an entire planet.

    "Description": "Ender\u0027s Game Nebula and Hugo Award Winner -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- From its first publication in January 1985, Ender\u0027s Game quickly became a classic in the science fiction field. It was greeted enthusiastically by the Science Fiction Writers of America, which gave it the Nebula Award for best novel of 1985, and the 1986 World Science Fiction Convention awarded Ender\u0027s Game the best novel Hugo. (What really stunned everyone was the following year, when the sequel, Speaker for the Dead, also won both awards -- something no author had ever done before, still less for a book and its sequel!) While Card has gone on to win other awards (two more Hugos, a World Fantasy Award, and in 1996 the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel of the year for his book Alvin Journeyman), Ender\u0027s Game continues to be his most popular novel, capturing the imagination of children, teenagers, and adults. Ender\u0027s Game has been translated into French, German, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, Czech, Danish, Finnish, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Swedish. Why does the story work so well? Many people call it \u0022the science fiction novel for people who don\u0027t think they like science fiction.\u0022 While the trappings of science fiction are there -- spaceships, aliens, futuristic machinery -- the reason the book works for so many people is that it\u0027s first and foremost a human story, of a boy who finds the burdens of the world placed on his back. Isolated and alone, his anguish resonates in the hearts of all readers. Yes, kids who read the book really enjoy the whole idea of the Battle School, a three-dimensional playspace where children in special suits have mock combats between armies. Others are intrigued by the military aspects of the book. When the Marine University at Quantico required students in one class to read Ender\u0027s Game, it wasn\u0027t for the strategy -- tactics in 3D space aren\u0027t really a big deal for the Marines. Rather, it was because Ender\u0027s Game is virtually a textbook in how to develop a strong relationship between a commander and his troops -- with plenty of examples also in how to fail as a commander. Other people -- especially in the online community -- love Ender\u0027s Game because of the powerful role it shows for computer networks in the world of the future. The Internet has taken a few steps in the direction shown by Ender\u0027s Game, but we\u0027re still a long way from a time when public discourse takes place primarily on the Internet and e-discussions can influence public policy. So Ender\u0027s Game is still a dream. Yet others find the \u0022Mind Game\u0022 most appealing. This is the computer game that students in the Battle School play, allowing their teachers to evaluate their emotional state. Ender, however, forces the computer to reprogram itself to allow him to play the game in new, unpredictable ways. The whole idea of a self-altering game that responds to the needs and desires of the player still intrigues many -- though Card has still not been able to persuade any computer game publishers to develop a self-creating game! Above all, though, Ender\u0027s Game is the story of growing up alone, trying to find independence when none is allowed, trying to find meaning in a life whose meaning has already been defined. Almost everyone has at some time felt himself or herself to be in the same kind of no-win situation as Ender Wiggin, and the triumph of the book is not that Ender Wiggin \u0022wins,\u0022 but that he grows up along the way. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright \u00A9 1985 Orson Scott Card A Tor Book - Published by Tom Doherty Associates, Inc.

    "Description": "Ender\u0027s Shadow : A Parallel Novel to Ender\u0027s Game Orson Scott Card brings us back to the very beginning of his brilliant Ender\u0027s Quartet, with a novel that allows us to reenter that world anew. With all the power of his original creation, Card has created a parallel volume to Ender\u0027s Game, a book that expands and complements the first, enhancing its power, illuminating its events and its powerful conclusion. The human race is at War with the \u0022Buggers,\u0022 an insect-like alien race. The first battles went badly, and now as Earth prepares to defend itself against the imminent threat of total destruction at the hands of an inscrutable alien enemy, all focus is on the development and training of military geniuses who can fight such a war, and win. The long distances of interstellar space have given hope to the defenders of Earth \u2014 they have time to train these future commanders up from childhood, forging them into an irresistible force in the high-orbital facility called the Battle School. Andrew \u0022Ender\u0022 Wiggin was not the only child in the Battle School; he was just the best of the best. In this new book, Card tells the story of another of those precocious generals, the one they called Bean \u2014 the one who became Ender\u0027s right hand, his strategist, and his friend. One who was with him, part of his team, in the final battle against the Buggers. Bean\u0027s past was a battle just to survive. He first appeared on the streets of Rotterdam, a tiny child with a mind leagues beyond anyone else\u0027s. He knew he could not survive through strength; he used his tactical genius to gain acceptance into a children\u0027s gang, and then to help make that gang a template for success for all the others. He civilized them, and lived to grow older. Bean\u0027s desperate struggle to live, and his success, brought him to the attention of the Battle School\u0027s recruiters, those people scouring the planet for leaders, tacticians, and generals to save Earth from the threat of alien invasion. Bean was sent into orbit, to the Battle School. And there he met Ender...\nSUMMARY:\nEnder\u0027s Shadow is being dubbed as a parallel novel to Orson Scott Card\u0027s Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Ender\u0027s Game. By \u0022parallel,\u0022 Card means that Shadow begins and ends at roughly the same time as Game, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity\u0027s fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender\u0027s lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of Shadow, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know. Although it may seem like Shadow is merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous Ender\u0027s Game, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It\u0027s clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of Ender\u0027s Game hinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, Shadow manages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that Shadow, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. --Craig E. Engler",

    "Description": "Ender\u0027s Game Nebula and Hugo Award Winner -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- From its first publication in January 1985, Ender\u0027s Game quickly became a classic in the science fiction field. It was greeted enthusiastically by the Science Fiction Writers of America, which gave it the Nebula Award for best novel of 1985, and the 1986 World Science Fiction Convention awarded Ender\u0027s Game the best novel Hugo. (What really stunned everyone was the following year, when the sequel, Speaker for the Dead, also won both awards -- something no author had ever done before, still less for a book and its sequel!) While Card has gone on to win other awards (two more Hugos, a World Fantasy Award, and in 1996 the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel of the year for his book Alvin Journeyman), Ender\u0027s Game continues to be his most popular novel, capturing the imagination of children, teenagers, and adults. Ender\u0027s Game has been translated into French, German, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, Czech, Danish, Finnish, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Swedish. Why does the story work so well? Many people call it \u0022the science fiction novel for people who don\u0027t think they like science fiction.\u0022 While the trappings of science fiction are there -- spaceships, aliens, futuristic machinery -- the reason the book works for so many people is that it\u0027s first and foremost a human story, of a boy who finds the burdens of the world placed on his back. Isolated and alone, his anguish resonates in the hearts of all readers. Yes, kids who read the book really enjoy the whole idea of the Battle School, a three-dimensional playspace where children in special suits have mock combats between armies. Others are intrigued by the military aspects of the book. When the Marine University at Quantico required students in one class to read Ender\u0027s Game, it wasn\u0027t for the strategy -- tactics in 3D space aren\u0027t really a big deal for the Marines. Rather, it was because Ender\u0027s Game is virtually a textbook in how to develop a strong relationship between a commander and his troops -- with plenty of examples also in how to fail as a commander. Other people -- especially in the online community -- love Ender\u0027s Game because of the powerful role it shows for computer networks in the world of the future. The Internet has taken a few steps in the direction shown by Ender\u0027s Game, but we\u0027re still a long way from a time when public discourse takes place primarily on the Internet and e-discussions can influence public policy. So Ender\u0027s Game is still a dream. Yet others find the \u0022Mind Game\u0022 most appealing. This is the computer game that students in the Battle School play, allowing their teachers to evaluate their emotional state. Ender, however, forces the computer to reprogram itself to allow him to play the game in new, unpredictable ways. The whole idea of a self-altering game that responds to the needs and desires of the player still intrigues many -- though Card has still not been able to persuade any computer game publishers to develop a self-creating game! Above all, though, Ender\u0027s Game is the story of growing up alone, trying to find independence when none is allowed, trying to find meaning in a life whose meaning has already been defined. Almost everyone has at some time felt himself or herself to be in the same kind of no-win situation as Ender Wiggin, and the triumph of the book is not that Ender Wiggin \u0022wins,\u0022 but that he grows up along the way. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright \u00A9 1985 Orson Scott Card A Tor Book - Published by Tom Doherty Associates, Inc. Jacket art by John Harris - Jacket design by Carol Russo\nSUMMARY:\nWinner of the Hugo and Nebula AwardsIn order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race\u0027s next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew \u0022Ender\u0022 Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn\u0027t make the cut\u2014young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.Ender\u0027s skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender\u0027s two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.",

    "Description": "Speaker for the Dead Nebula and Hugo Award Winner -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Three thousand planet-bound years have fled since Ender Wiggin won humanity\u0027s war with the Buggers by totally destroying them. Ender remains young-travelling the stars at relativistic speeds, a hundred years or more might pass while he experiences a month-long voyage. In three thousand years, his books The Hive Queen and The Hegemon have become holy writ, and the name of Ender anathema; he is the Xenocide, the one who killed an entire race of thinking, feeling beings, the only other sapient race humankind had found in all the galaxy. The only ones, that is, until the planet called Lusitania was discovered and colonized. On Lusitania humans found another race of ramen ... a young race, beings just beginning to lift their eyes to the stars and wonder what might be out there. The discovery was seen as a gift to humanity, a chance to redeem the destruction of the Buggers. And so the Pequininos, as they were named by the portuguese-speaking settlers, the \u0022Piggies,\u0022 were placed off-limits to the colony. The only humans allowed to meet them and speak with them are trained xenobiologists, and then only two at a time. This time, there will be no tragic misunderstandings leading to war. This time... This time, again, men die -bizarrely killed by the Piggies. Andrew Wiggin is called to Lusitania to Speak the deaths of the two xenobiologists, and walks into a maelstrom of fear and hatred. To Speak for these dead, he must first unravel the web of secrets surrounding the lives of the Piggies and those who study them. He must Speak not only for the dead, but for a living alien race. This magnificent sequel to ENDER\u0027S GAME won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award for Best SF Novel of the Year. Orson Scott Card is one of the finest, most innovative writers of the past decade, whose works also include the acclaimed alternate world fantasy series, The Tales of Alvin Maker.

    "Description": "Children of the Mind Orson Scott Card returns at last to the story of Ender Wiggin, the child hero of the Hugo and Nebula award winner Ender\u0027s Game, who as a man found a way to redeem the Xenocide of his youth and restore the Hive Queen to life. Now his adopted world, Lusitania, is threatened by the same planet-destroying weapon that he himself used so many thousands of years before. Lusitania is home to three sentient species: The Pequeninos, a strange race native to Lusitania; a large colony of humans; and the Hive Queen, brought there by Ender. But the Starways Congress fears Lusitania and a strange virus that it harbors, and they have gathered a fleet to destroy the planet. Ender\u0027s oldest friend, Jane, the computer intelligence that has evolved with him over three thousand years, allowed the Starways Congress to discover her existence when she tried t stop the fleet. Now they are trying to kill her as well, by shutting down the network of computers and ansibles in which she lives. They are afraid of her and of her control over all human communications. Jane can save the three sentient races of Lusitania. She has learned how to move ships outside the universe, and then instantly back to a different world, abolishing the light-speed limit. But it takes all the processing power available to her, and the Starways Congress is shutting down the Net world by world. Soon she will not be able to move the ships. But there is hope: during the first trip outside, Ender\u0027s mind briefly took control and created two new beings - replicas of his brother Peter, who was the Hegemon, and his sister Valentine. These two children of Ender\u0027s mind, together with his adopted children from Lusitania, are racing against time to discover new worlds, to influence the Starways Congress to recall the fleet, and to save Jane by finding a home for her disembodied intelligence once the Human Network is closed off to her.",

    "Description": "Ender\u0027s Shadow : A Parallel Novel to Ender\u0027s Game Orson Scott Card brings us back to the very beginning of his brilliant Ender\u0027s Quartet, with a novel that allows us to reenter that world anew. With all the power of his original creation, Card has created a parallel volume to Ender\u0027s Game, a book that expands and complements the first, enhancing its power, illuminating its events and its powerful conclusion. The human race is at War with the \u0022Buggers,\u0022 an insect-like alien race. The first battles went badly, and now as Earth prepares to defend itself against the imminent threat of total destruction at the hands of an inscrutable alien enemy, all focus is on the development and training of military geniuses who can fight such a war, and win. The long distances of interstellar space have given hope to the defenders of Earth \u2014 they have time to train these future commanders up from childhood, forging them into an irresistible force in the high-orbital facility called the Battle School. Andrew \u0022Ender\u0022 Wiggin was not the only child in the Battle School; he was just the best of the best. In this new book, Card tells the story of another of those precocious generals, the one they called Bean \u2014 the one who became Ender\u0027s right hand, his strategist, and his friend. One who was with him, part of his team, in the final battle against the Buggers. Bean\u0027s past was a battle just to survive. He first appeared on the streets of Rotterdam, a tiny child with a mind leagues beyond anyone else\u0027s. He knew he could not survive through strength; he used his tactical genius to gain acceptance into a children\u0027s gang, and then to help make that gang a template for success for all the others. He civilized them, and lived to grow older. Bean\u0027s desperate struggle to live, and his success, brought him to the attention of the Battle School\u0027s recruiters, those people scouring the planet for leaders, tacticians, and generals to save Earth from the threat of alien invasion. Bean was sent into orbit, to the Battle School. And there he met Ender...",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nIn Shadow Puppets, Orson Scott Card continues the storyline of Shadow of the Hegemon, following the exploits of the Battle School children, prodigies who have returned to an Earth thrown into chaos after the unifying force of the alien invasion they stopped in Ender\u0027s Game and Ender\u0027s Shadow has dissipated. Foremost among these whiz kids is the brilliant Bean who, in Shadow of the Hegemon, rescued his comrades from his nemesis--the dastardly Achilles. Now, the down-but-not-out evil genius is again scheming towards global domination and vengeance against the irrepressible Bean. It\u0027s up to Bean and his newfound love, Petra, to outwit the young psychopath and save the world. Meanwhile, the other Battle School children are called to serve again as an expansionist China threatens the stability of post-Bugger War Earth. Shadow Puppets is, for better or worse, exactly what readers have come to expect from Card. There are thought-provoking musings on geopolitics, war, courage, arrogance, good versus evil, and the concept of children wise beyond their years dealing with grave responsibility. Unfortunately, many of these furnishings are looking a little frayed around the edges, but fans will enjoy an exciting, fast-paced plot and a suspense-filled conclusion. --Jeremy Pugh",

The only ones, that is, until the planet called Lusitania was discovered and colonized. On Lusitania humans found another race of ramen ... a young race, beings just beginning to lift their eyes to the stars and wonder what might be out there. The discovery was seen as a gift to humanity, a chance to redeem the destruction of the Buggers. And so the Pequininos, as they were named by the portuguese-speaking settlers, the \u0022Piggies,\u0022 were placed off-limits to the colony. The only humans allowed to meet them and speak with them are trained xenobiologists, and then only two at a time. This time, there will be no tragic misunderstandings leading to war. This time... This time, again, men die -bizarrely killed by the Piggies. Andrew Wiggin is called to Lusitania to Speak the deaths of the two xenobiologists, and walks into a maelstrom of fear and hatred. To Speak for these dead, he must first unravel the web of secrets surrounding the lives of the Piggies and those who study them. He must Speak not only for the dead, but for a living alien race. This magnificent sequel to ENDER\u0027S GAME won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award for Best SF Novel of the Year. Orson Scott Card is one of the finest, most innovative writers of the past decade, whose works also include the acclaimed alternate world fantasy series, The Tales of Alvin Maker.

In that time his name has become anathema, for he is the one who killed an entire race of thinking, feeling beings. No other has been found - until Lusitania is discovered. The young race there offers mankind a chance to redeem the previous destruction. The only humans allowed near are trained xenobiologists. But once again there are tragic misunderstandings. And when Ender, as Andrew Wiggin, is called to Lusitania to speak for the dead - to present to the community the terrible truth of why men have been killed by aliens - his actions can, and will, reverberate through an entire galactic empire.\n\n",

    "Description": "Xenocide The millennia-long saga of Andrew Wiggin called Ender, called The Speaker For the Dead called The Xenocide continues .... On the world Lusitania there are now three sapient races-the Pequeninos, who evolved there; Humans, who came to colonize; and a Hive Queen and her children brought by Ender long years ago. But on Lusitania there is also the descolada, a virus deadly to human beings which would spread like wildfire throughout the Stairways Congress should it ever escape the planet. The Starways Congress decided that The descolada should be wiped out once and for all, and sent a fleet, armed with a planet-destroying weapon, to do it. A fourth intelligence, loyal to Ender and Lusitania caused that fleet to disappear. On a distant world called Path live a people whose culture owes much to that of ancient China on Earth. They have evolved a caste known as the godspoken, people of superior intellectual abilities who pay a terrible price for their gifts. The godspoken of Path have given their loyalty and service to the Starways Congress. Among the god spoken is a young girl named, in The language of her people, Gloriously Bright. It is to her that the Starways Congress turn with the mystery of the disappearance of the Lusitania Fleet. There is no doubt that Gloriously Bright will discover the answer to the puzzle. The question is, what will she do with the information\nSUMMARY:\nOrson Scott Card\u0027s Xenocide is a space opera with verve. In this continuation of Ender Wiggin\u0027s story, the Starways Congress has sent a fleet to immolate the rebellious planet of Lusitania, home to the alien race of pequeninos, and home to Ender Wiggin and his family. Concealed on Lusitania is the only remaining Hive Queen, who holds a secret that may save or destroy humanity throughout the galaxy. Familiar characters from the previous novels continue to grapple with religious conflicts and family squabbles while inventing faster-than-light travel and miraculous virus treatments. Throw into the mix an entire planet of mad geniuses and a self-aware computer who wants to be a martyr, and it\u0027s hard to guess who will topple the first domino. Due to the densely woven and melodramatic nature of the story, newcomers to Ender\u0027s tale will want to start reading this series with the first books, Ender\u0027s Game and Speaker for the Dead. --Brooks Peck",

In the decades since his death in September 1973, millions have read THE HOBBIT, THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and THE SILMARILLION and become fascinated about the very private man behind the books. \n\n\t\n\nBorn in South Africa in January 1892, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was orphaned in childhood and brought up in near-poverty. He served in the first World War, surviving the Battle of the Somme, where he lost many of the closest friends he\u0027d ever had. After the war he returned to the academic life, achieving high repute as a scholar and university teacher, eventually becoming Merton Professor of English at Oxford where he was a close friend of C.S. Lewis and the other writers known as The Inklings.\n\n\n\nThen suddenly his life changed dramatically. One day while grading essay papers he found himself writing \u0027In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit\u0027 -- and worldwide renown awaited him. \n\n\n\nHumphrey Carpenter was given unrestricted access to all Tolkien\u0027s papers, and interviewed his friends and family. From these sources he follows the long and painful process of creation that produced THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE SILMARILLION and offers a wealth of information about the life and work of the twentieth century\u0027s most cherished author.",

John Bandicut and several aliens and artificial intelligences have been thrown together by a force greater than themselves to prevent cataclysmic disasters on an interstellar scale. Now, before they can take a break after a world-saving mission, they are pulled into a waystation that is being threatened by highly destructive gravity waves.The waves are part of a much larger problem. Something is causing stars to become unstable and go prematurely nova--they\u0027re being murdered. When the waystation is destroyed by the gravity waves, Bandicut and his crew barely escape on a jury-rigged ship.

The Hugo and Nebula award-winning Rendezvous with Rama, the bestselling Rama II, and The Garden of Rama were only the prelude to this stunning conclusion to an epic journey. On its mysterious voyage through interstellar space, a massive, alien starship carries its passengers to the end of a generations-long odyssey. For the great experiment conceived by the Ramans has failed. Rama III, with its carefully designed Earth habitat, as well as environments to house other intelligent species, has become a battleground. Instead of creating a utopia, the human contingent has brought forth a tyrant who seeks to conquer the other sectors of the vast Raman ark. Cosmonaut Nicole des Jardins, a lone voice for reason who is now jailed and awaiting execution, is aided in a daring escape by two tiny robots. On New York Island, the dark, brood deserted city in the midst of Rama III\u0027s cylindrical sea, Nicole is reunited with her long-lost husband, Richard Wakefield, whom she\u0027d given up for dead. Joined by their children and other rebels from the Earth sector, Nicole and Richard enter New York\u0027s labyrinthine underground aboard a ghostly subway hoping to find the ship\u0027s secret inner workings. What they find instead is the emerald-domed lair of the technologically advanced species that rules this fabulous subraman world: the octospiders. These arachnidlike creatures are luring Nicole and the rebels into their domain, but the Earth group is divided as to whether the octospiders are allies or enemies - and anxious to discover the fate of two oftheir group abducted by the enigmatic aliens. Yet even as this drama unfolds, Rama III continues its inexorable course to its final destination: the Node. To some, the Node is a vast engineering station; to others, it is a place of wonder and miracles. From here a powerful force ha",

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nThe countdown to doomsday began with the discovery in 1956 of the neutrino, a particle with no mass and no charge. By the year 2001, the significance of this phantom particle was understood: it was a harbinger. A cosmic event was imminent, and would be close enough to touch. Soon the Sun would go nova; the demolition of Earth was assured. And so it happened in the year 3620.  Over the centuries of knowing the end was at hand, humanity pulled together to launch probes into space. Primitive ships, at first, carrying embryos to distant systems, relying on machines to incubate and rear the first people of a virgin land beneath an alien sun. On Earth the Lords of the Last Days lived with no need to care for the future of the world; it was the wildest of times, and the saddest. Last to leave was the Magellan carrying a million homeless; when cataclysm struck, its voyagers witnessed through telescopes the death of Earth and all its wonders, saw the Atlantic boil dry, the pyramids disintegrate, the land of Antarctica briefly bare of ice before fire consumed everything. Then the million slept.  Five hundred years later, the Magellan must make planetfall to repair its quantum drive.  Its sleepers awake to find themselves visitors to Thalassa, where a cvilization has, in fact, survived. A clash of cultures unlike any before brings danger, despair, and some very tough decisions for two different peoples far from Earth - and its distant songs.",

Wells,\u0022 say other critics. Cummings has an unusual flair for things scientific as evidenced by the fact that while at Princeton University he accomplished the remarkable feat of absorbing three years of physics in that many months. His five years\u0027 association with Thomas Edison as the latter\u0027s personal assistant also added to Cummings\u0027s scientific knowledge. His bizarre early life, living on orange plantations in Puerto Rico, striking oil in Wyoming, gold seeking in British Columbia, timber cruising in the North, before he was twenty, also left its imprint.  \u0022Leaving Mr. Edison\u0027s employ, Cummings began writing scientific fiction for many magazines. His stories gripped the popular imagination and they \u0022clicked.\u0022 Mr. Cummings\u0027s success as a writer has been meteoric, for in a few years he has become one of the world\u0027s most popular authors of scientific fiction.... --Argosy-Allstory Weekly, Feb. 8, 1930",

Thousands of autonomous computer programs, or daemons, make our networked world possible, running constantly in the background of our lives, trafficking e-mail, transferring money, and monitoring power grids. For the most part, daemons are benign, but the same can\u2019t always be said for the people who design them.\n\n\n\n Matthew Sobol was a legendary computer game designer\u2014the architect behind half-a-dozen popular online games. His premature death depressed both gamers and his company\u2019s stock price. But Sobol\u2019s fans aren\u2019t the only ones to note his passing. When his obituary is posted online, a previously dormant daemon activates, initiating a chain of events intended to unravel the fabric of our hyper-efficient, interconnected world. With Sobol\u2019s secrets buried along with him, and as new layers of his daemon are unleashed at every turn, it\u2019s up to an unlikely alliance to decipher his intricate plans and wrest the world from the grasp of a nameless, faceless enemy\u2014or learn to live in a society in which we are no longer in control. . . .\n\n\n\n Computer technology expert Daniel Suarez blends haunting high-tech realism with gripping suspense in an authentic, complex thriller in the tradition of Michael Crichton, Neal Stephenson, and William Gibson.\n\n",

Here you will find slyly twisted alternate histories, fractured fairy tales, topical science fiction, and edgy urban fantasy. In \u201CDaltharee,\u201D World Fantasy Award-winning author Jeffrey Ford spins a chilling tale of a city in a bottle\u2013and the demented genius who put it there. In \u201CSonny Liston Takes the Fall,\u201D John W. Campbell Award-winning author Elizabeth Bear pens a poignant and eerie requiem for the heavyweight forever associated with his controversial loss to Cassius Clay. From hot new writer Margo Lanagan comes \u201CThe Goosle,\u201D a dark, astonishing take on Hansel and Gretel. In the novella \u201CPrisoners of the Action,\u201D Paul MccAuley and Kim Newman take a trip down a rabbit hole that leads to a Guantanamo-like prison whose inmates are not just illegal but extraterrestrial. Many of the writers you\u2019ll recognize. Others you may not. But one thing is certain: These stars of today and tomorrow demonstrate that the field of speculative fiction is not only alive and well\u2013it\u2019s better than ever.",

On the orders of Argo, the White Goddess, an itinerant poet and his three companions journey to the island of Aptor. Their mission: to seize a jewel from the dark god Hama and bring it back home. With this precious stone Argo may defeat the malign forces gathered against her and the land of Leptor. But, as the group presses deep into the enigmatic heart of Aptor, easy distinctions between good and evil blur, and somehow the task seems less straightforward. For Argo already owns two of the jewels, and possession of the third would give her unqualified power. And, as the four friends already know, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nNobody but Philip K. Dick could so successfully combine SF comedy with the unease of reality gone wrong, shifting underfoot like quicksand. Besides grisly ideas like funeral parlors where you swap gossip for the advice of the frozen dead, Ubik (1969) offers such deadpan farce as a moneyless character\u0027s attack on the robot apartment door that demands a five-cent toll: \u0022I\u0027ll sue you,\u0022 the door said as the first screw fell out. Joe Chip said, \u0022I\u0027ve never been sued by a door. But I guess I can live through it.\u0022 Chip works for Glen Runciter\u0027s anti-psi security agency, which hires out its talents to block telepathic snooping and paranormal dirty tricks. When its special team tackles a big job on the Moon, something goes terribly wrong. Runciter is killed, it seems--but messages from him now appear on toilet walls, traffic tickets, or product labels. Meanwhile, fragments of reality are timeslipping into past versions: Joe Chip\u0027s beloved stereo system reverts to a hand-cranked 78 player with bamboo needles. Why does Runciter\u0027s face appear on U.S. coins? Why the repeated ads for a hard-to-find universal panacea called Ubik (\u0022safe when taken as directed\u0022)? The true, chilling state of affairs slowly becomes clear, though the villain isn\u0027t who Joe Chip thinks. And this is Dick country, where final truths are never quite final and--with the help of Ubik--the reality/illusion balance can still be tilted the other way. --David Langford, Amazon.co.uk",

Those who remained coveted any living creature, and for people who couldn\u0027t afford one, companies built incredibly realistic simulacrae: horses, birds, cats, sheep. . . They even built humans.Emigrees to Mars received androids so sophisticated it was impossible to tell them from true men or women. Fearful of the havoc these artificial humans could wreak, the government banned them from Earth. But when androids didn\u0027t want to be identified, they just blended in. Rick Deckard was an officially sanctioned bounty hunter whose job was to find rogue androids, and to retire them. But cornered, androids tended to fight back, with deadly results.\u0022[Dick] sees all the sparkling and terrifying possibilities. . . that other authors shy away from.\u0022--Paul Williams Rolling Stone",

The author of thirty-six novels, including the acclaimed *Blade Runner*, and five short story collections, he won a Hugo Award for *The Man in the High Castle,* and a John W. Campbell Memorial Award *for Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said.* He died in 1982.In the world of *The Minority Report, *Commissioner John Anderton is the one to thank for the lack of crime. He is the originator of the Precrime System, which uses \u0022precogs\u0022\u2013people with the power to see into the future\u2013to identify criminals before they can do any harm. Unfortunately for Anderton, his precogs perceive *him *as the next criminal. But Anderton knows he has never contemplated such a thing, and this knowledge proves the precogs are fallible. Now, whichever way he turns, Anderton is doomed\u2013unless he can find the precogs\u0027s \u0022minority report\u0022\u2013the dissenting voice that represents his one hope of getting at the truth in time to save himself from his own system.A film version of *The Minority Report*, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise, will be released this summer\u2013further proof of the enduring appeal of Philip K.

This week they will destroy the world.   The vampiric virus unleashed in The Strain has taken over New York City. It is spreading and soon will envelop the globe. Amid the chaos, Eph Goodweather\u2014head of the Centers for Disease Control\u0027s team\u2014leads a band out to stop these bloodthirsty monsters. But it may be too late.   Ignited by the Master\u0027s horrific plan, a war erupts between Old and New World vampires, each vying for control. At the center of the conflict lies a book, an ancient text that contains the vampires\u0027 entire history . . . and their darkest secrets. Whoever finds the book can control the outcome of the war and, ultimately, the fate of us all. And it is between these warring forces that humans\u2014powerless and vulnerable\u2014find themselves no longer the consumers but the consumed.

His ex-wife, Kelly, has been transformed into a bloodcrazed creature of the night, and now she stalks the city looking for her chance to reclaim her Dear One: Zack, Eph\u0027s young son.

I\n   loved Chuck\u0027s style and ideas from reading his books and I specifically wanted\n   him as a partner because he had a strong sense of reality and had NEVER\n   written a horror book.

Setrakian pins his hopes for stopping\n   the vampires on tracking down a 17th-century grimoire that describes the\n   origins of their leaders, the Seven Original Ancients. Despite the story\u0027s\n   essential grimness, the authors manage to inject some sardonic humor, even as\n   the plot developments will leave readers wondering how the concluding book can\n   possibly end well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECopyright \u00A9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They were the men who had  nothing to lose.  \n\nCaptain Jim Vaughn is a soldier in disgrace. Commanding a special forces  mission to capture terrorists in the Philippines, Vaughn\u0027s team is destroyed,  and when the smoke clears, he is the one made the scapegoat. Forced into the  shadows by the scandal, Vaughn is offered a chance to redeem himself when he is  approached by an enigmatic government agent looking for a few desperate men. \n\nVaughn is recruited into a new team, but is shocked to meet his new  teammates, a group of men outside of the regular chain of command. These were  men who had used up all their second chances. These are men who have crossed the  line one too many times. Drug users. Felons. The insane. The terminally ill.  These are now the men that Vaughn must trust with his life. \n\nThis group of outcasts and misfits has been assembled for two reasons they  are skilled, and they are expendable. These are the kinds of men who are needed  to attempt missions the government can\u0027t acknowledge, the country can\u0027t condone,  and the team cannot fail. But the deeper Vaughn gets into the unique group, the  more he realizes that the organization may be concealing more than the rap  sheets of its most unusual operators. A team of such unique properties is the  perfect tool to use againt America\u0027s enemies...and possibly America itself.\n\n",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nWhen called to do battle many light years from home, the 1st Marine Interstellar Expeditionary Unit rose to the challenge -- and now thousands of enslaved humans have been freed from the alien yoke. But Earth is twenty-one years older than the home planet they originally left, and the Marines need time to retrain and readjust -- time they do not have, due to the bizzare disappearance of a detachment of their brothers- and sisters-in-arms. It is a mystery, but there is a starting point: an ancient wormhole threading through the Sirius system. Whatever waits on the other side must be confronted, with stealth, with force, and without fear -- be it an ancient enemy or a devastating new threat.   The Marines are heading into the perilous unknown . . . and what transpires there could reshape the universe for millennia to come.",

Renowned editor Gardner Dozois assembles seventeen such escapades here, with stories from today\u0027s and tomorrow\u0027s finest writers, including: Stephen Baxter, Tony Daniel, R.

Here now, on the brink of the twenty-first century, the future remains as distant and as unknowable as ever . . . and science fiction stories continue to explore it with delightful results:Collected in this anthology are such imaginative gems as:\u0022The Wedding Album\u0022 by David Marusek. In a high-tech future, the line between reality and simulation has grown thin . . . and it\u0027s often hard to tell who\u0027s on what side.\u0022Everywhere\u0022 by Geoff Ryman. Do the people who live in utopian conditions ever recognize them as such?\u0022Hatching the Phoenix\u0022 by Frederik Pohl. One of science fiction\u0027s Grand Masters returns with a star-crossing tale of the Heechee---the enigmatic, vanished aliens whose discarded technology guides mankind through the future.\u0022A Hero of the Empire\u0022 by Robert Silverberg. Showing that the past is as much a province of the imagination as the future, this novelette returns to an alternate history when the Roman Empire never fell to show us just how the course of history can be altered.The twenty-seven stories in this collection imaginatively take us to nearby planets and distant futures, into the past and into universes no larger than a grain of sand. Included here are the works of masters of the form and of bright new talents.Supplementing the stories are the editor\u0027s insightful summation of the year\u0027s events and a lengthy list of honorable mentions, making this book a valuable resource in addition to serving as the single best place in the universe to find stories that stir the imagination and the heart.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nThe twenty-first century has so far proven to be exciting and wondrous and filled with challenges we had never dreamed. New possibilities previously unimagined appear almost daily . . . and science fiction stories continue to explore those possibilities with delightful results:Collected in this anthology are such compelling stories as:\u0022On K2 with Kanakaredes\u0022 by Dan Simmons. A relentlessly paced and absorbing tale set in the near future about three mountain climbers who must scale the face of K2 with some very odd company. \u0022The Human Front\u0022 by Ken MacLeod. In this compassionate coming-of-age tale the details of life are just a bit off from things as we know them-and nothing is as it appears to be.\u0022Glacial\u0022 by Alastair Reynolds. A fascinating discovery on a distant planet leads to mass death and a wrenching mystery as spellbinding as anything in recent short fiction. The twenty-six stories in this collection imaginatively takes us far across the universe, into the very core of our beings, to the realm of the gods, and the moment just after now. Included here are the works of masters of the form and of bright new talents, including:Eleanor ArnasonChris BeckettMichael BlumleinMichael CassuttBrenda W. CloughPaul Di FilippoAndy DuncanCarolyn Ives GilmanJim GrimsleySimon IngsJames Patrick KellyLeigh KennedyNancy KressIan R. MacLeodKen MacLeodPaul J. McAuleyMaureen F. McHughRobert ReedAlastair ReynoldsGeoff RymanWilliam SandersDan SimmonsAllen M. SteeleCharles StrossMichael SwanwickHoward WaldropSupplementing the stories are the editor\u0027s insightful summation of the year\u0027s events and a lengthy list of honorable mentions, making this book a valuable resource in addition to serving as the single best place in the universe to find stories that stir the imagination and the heart.",

She makes clear why praising intelligence and ability doesn\u0027t foster self-esteem and lead to accomplishment, but may actually jeopardize success. With the right mindset, we can motivate our kids and help them to raise their grades, as well as reach our own goals--personal and professional. Dweck reveals what all great parents, teachers, CEOs, and athletes already know: how a simple idea about the brain can create a love of learning and a resilience that is the basis of great accomplishment in every area.\u003C/p\u003E",

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nThe stranger at the side of the road doesn\u2019t know much  about himself, but he knows he is definitely not Elvis. That aside,  the baby driving the car has his own set of problems. Now they\u2019re  off to experience the southwest in the only vehicle that makes sense  for both of them: a carnation-pink 1963 Cadillac El Dorado...    \n\nMagicCon is an ordinary fantasy/science fiction convention. Three days  of comic books, anime, and X-Files jokes, which is exactly what Larry  and his friends are looking for. Unfortunately for Larry, a  long-forgotten Roman god named Stercutus is primed to make a comeback,  and this particular god\u2019s sphere of influence really stinks...    \n\nSet in and around the fictional city of San Cibola, *Gods New and Used*  is a stand-alone companion piece to Clockwork Storybook, an online  shared world anthology of urban fantasy.  Mark Finn\u2019s contributions  are often larger than life; they can be both sublime and ridiculous,  both wise and painfully dumb. Like the gods he portrays, Finn\u2019s  writing style ranges from heroic to slap-happy, weaving together broad  comedy and genuine emotion into something that is nothing less than  true to life.    \n\nThe stories in this collection showcase what Finn does best:  corralling the supernatural and the archetypal, and bringing them down  to earth, to sit next to you in the passenger seat as you cruise along  a highway somewhere in the California desert. Here you will meet the  embodiments of love, of thunder, and of rock and roll, and discover  about them what is frequently overlooked: that the gods are often more  human than we are.",

A weapon that may already be in the hands of our enemies.\n\n \n\n*\n\nMonths before publication, *One Second After* has already been cited on the floor of Congress as a book all Americans should read, a book already being discussed in the corridors of the Pentagon as a truly realistic look at a weapon and its awesome power to destroy the entire United States, literally within one second. It is a weapon that the *Wall Street Journal* warns could shatter America. In the tradition of *On the Beach*, *Fail Safe* and *Testament*, this book, set in a typical American town, is a dire warning of what might be our future...and our end.",

As a science journalist covering the competition, Foer became captivated by the secrets of the competitors, like how the current world memory champion, Ben Pridmore, could memorize the exact order of 1,528 digits in an hour. He met with individuals whose memories are truly unique\u2014from one man whose memory only extends back to his most recent thought, to another who can memorize complex mathematical formulas without knowing any math. Brains remember visual imagery but have a harder time with other information, like lists, and so with the help of experts, Foer learned how to transform the kinds of memories he forgot into the kind his brain remembered naturally. The techniques he mastered made it easier to remember information, and Foer\u0027s story demonstrates that the tricks of the masters are accessible to anyone. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003E--Miriam Landis\u003C/em\u003E   \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAuthor Q\u0026amp;A with Joshua Foer\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ:\u003C/strong\u003E First, can you explain the title of you book, \u003Cem\u003EMoonwalking with Einstein\u003C/em\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA:\u003C/strong\u003E The title refers to a memory device I used in the US Memory Championship\u2014specifically it\u0027s a mnemonic that helped me memorize a deck of playing cards. Moonwalking with Einstein works as a mnemonic because it\u0027s such a goofy image. Things that are weird or colorful are the most memorable. If you try to picture Albert Einstein sliding backwards across a dance floor wearing penny loafers and a diamond glove, that\u0027s pretty much unforgettable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ:\u003C/strong\u003E What are the U.S. Memory Championships? How did you become involved?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA:\u003C/strong\u003E The U.S. Memory Championship is a rather bizarre contest held each spring in New York City, in which people get together to see who can remember the most names of strangers, the most lines of poetry, the most random digits. I went to the event as a science journalist, to cover what I assumed would be the Super Bowl of savants. But when I talked to the competitors, they told me something really interesting. They weren\u0027t savants. And they didn\u0027t have photographic memories. Rather, they\u0027d trained their memories using ancient techniques. They said anyone could do it. I was skeptical. Frankly, I didn\u0027t believe them. I said, well, if anyone can do it, could you teach me? A guy named Ed Cooke, who has one of the best trained memories in the world, took me under his wing and taught me everything he knew about memory techniques. A year later I came back to the contest, this time to try and compete, as a sort of exercise in participatory journalism. I was curious simply to see how well I\u0027d do, but I ended up winning the contest. That really wasn\u0027t supposed to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ:\u003C/strong\u003E What was the most surprising thing you found out about yourself competing in the Memory Championships?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA:\u003C/strong\u003E In the process of studying these techniques, I learned something remarkable: that there\u0027s far more potential in our minds than we often give them credit for. I\u0027m not just talking about the fact that it\u0027s possible to memorize lots of information using memory techniques. I\u0027m talking about a lesson that is more general, and in a way much bigger: that it\u0027s possible, with training and hard work, to teach oneself to do something that might seem really difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ:\u003C/strong\u003E Can you explain the \u0022OK Plateau?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA:\u003C/strong\u003E The OK Plateau is that place we all get to where we just stop getting better at something. Take typing, for example. You might type and type and type all day long, but once you reach a certain level, you just never get appreciably faster at it. That\u0027s because it\u0027s become automatic. You\u0027ve moved it to the back of your mind\u0027s filing cabinet. If you want to become a faster typer, it\u0027s possible, of course. But you\u0027ve got to bring the task back under your conscious control. You\u0027ve got to push yourself past where you\u0027re comfortable. You have to watch yourself fail and learn from your mistakes. That\u0027s the way to get better at anything. And it\u0027s how I improved my memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ:\u003C/strong\u003E What do you mean by saying there an \u0022art\u0022 to memory?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA:\u003C/strong\u003E The \u0022art of memory\u0022 refers to a set of techniques that were invented in ancient Greece. These are the same techniques that Cicero used to memorize his speeches, and that medieval scholars used to memorize entire books. The \u0022art\u0022 is in creating imagery in your mind that is so unusual, so colorful, so unlike anything you\u0027ve ever seen before that it\u0027s unlikely to be forgotten. That\u0027s why mnemonists like to say that their skills are as much about creativity as memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ:e to say that their skills are as much about creativity as memory.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ:\u003C/strong\u003E How do you think technology has affected how and what we remember?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA:\u003C/strong\u003E Once upon a time people invested in their memories, they cultivated them. They studiously furnished their minds. They remembered. Today, of course, we\u0027ve got books, and computers and smart phones to hold our memories for us. We\u0027ve outsourced our memories to external devices. The result is that we no longer trust our memories. We see every small forgotten thing as evidence that they\u0027re failing us altogether. We\u0027ve forgotten how to remember.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ:\u003C/strong\u003E What is the connection between memory and our sense of time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA:\u003C/strong\u003E As we get older, life seems to fly by faster and faster. That\u0027s because we structure our experience of time around memories. We remember events in relation to other events. But as we get older, and our experiences become less unique, our memories can blend together. If yesterday\u0027s lunch is indistinguishable from the one you ate the day before, it\u0027ll end up being forgotten. That\u0027s why it\u0027s so hard to remember meals. In the same way, if you\u0027re not doing things that are unique and different and memorable, this year can come to resemble the last, and end up being just as forgettable as yesterday\u0027s lunch. That\u0027s why it\u0027s so important to pack your life with interesting experiences that make your life memorable, and provide a texture to the passage of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ:\u003C/strong\u003E How is your memory now?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA:\u003C/strong\u003E Ironically, not much better than when I started this whole journey. The techniques I learned, and used in the memory contest, are great for remembering structured information like shopping lists or phone numbers, but they don\u0027t improve any sort of underlying, generalizable memory ability. Unfortunately, I still misplace my car keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Photo of Joshua Foer \u00A9 Emil Salman Haaretz)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFrom\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ememories, such as the extensive training British cabbies must undergo. He also discusses ways we can train ourselves to have better memories, like the PAO system, in which, for example, every card in a deck is associated with an image of a specific person, action, or object.

Diego, a seventeen-year-old illegal Mexican immigrant, owes his salvation to master grifter Thomas Schell. Together with Schell\u0027s gruff and powerful partner, they sail comfortably through hard times, scamming New York\u0027s grieving rich with elaborate, ingeniously staged s\u00E9ances -- until an impossible occurrence changes everything. While \u0022communing with spirits,\u0022 Schell sees an image of a young girl in a pane of glass, silently entreating the con man for help. Though well aware that his otherworldly \u0022powers\u0022 are a sham, Schell inexplicably offers his services to help find the lost child -- drawing Diego along with him into a tangled maze of deadly secrets and terrible experimentation. At once a hypnotically compelling mystery and a stunningly evocative portrait of Depression-era New York, The Girl in the Glass is a masterly literary adventure from a writer of exemplary vision and skill.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nIn New York\u0027s Long Island, in the unpredictable decade of the 1960s, a young boy laments the approaching close of summer and the advent of sixth grade. Growing up in a household with an overworked father whom he rarely sees, an alcoholic mother who paints wonderful canvases that are never displayed, an older brother who serves as both tormentor and protector, and a younger sister who inhabits her own secret world, the boy takes his amusements where he can find them. Some of his free time is spent in the basement of the family\u0027s modest home, where he and his brother, Jim, have created Botch Town, a detailed cardboard replica of their community, complete with clay figurines representing friends and neighbors. And so the time passes with a not-always-reassuring sameness\u2014until the night a prowler is reported stalking the neighborhood.   Appointing themselves ad hoc investigators, the brothers set out to aid the police\u2014while their little sister, Mary, smokes cigarettes, speaks in other voices, inhabits alternate personas . . . and, unbeknownst to her older siblings, moves around the inanimate residents of Botch Town. But ensuing events add a shadowy cast to the boys\u0027 night games: disappearances, deaths, and spectral sightings capped off by the arrival of a sinister man in a long white car trawling the neighborhood after dark. Strangest of all is the inescapable fact that every one of these troubling occurrences seems to correspond directly to the changes little Mary has made to the miniature town in the basement.   Not since Ray Bradbury\u0027s classic Dandelion Wine has a novel so richly evoked the dark magic of small-town boyhood. At once a hypnotically compelling mystery, a masterful re-creation of a unique time and place, a celebration of youth, and a poignant and disquieting portrait of home and family\u2014all balancing on a razor\u0027s edge separating reality from the unsettlingly remarkable\u2014The Shadow Year is a monumental new work from one of contemporary fiction\u0027s most fearless and inventive artists.",

    "Description": "Richard Mayhew is an unassuming young businessman living in London, with a dull job and a pretty but demanding fiancee. Then one night he stumbles across a girl bleeding on the sidewalk. He stops to help her--and the life he knows vanishes like smoke.\nSeveral hours later, the girl is gone too. And by the following morning Richard Mayhew has been erased from his world. His bank cards no longer work, taxi drivers won\u0027t stop for him, his hundred rents his apartment out to strangers. He has become invisible, and inexplicably consigned to a London of shadows and darkness a city of monsters and saints, murderers and angels, that exists entirely in a subterranean labyrinth of sewer canals andabandoned subway stations. He has fallen through the cracks of reality and has landed somewhere different, somewhere that is Neverwhere.\nFor this is the home of Door, the mysterious girl whom Richard rescued in the London Above. A personage of great power and nobility in this murky, candlelit realm, she is on a mission to discover the cause of her family\u0027s slaughter, and in doing so preserve this strange underworld kingdom from the malevolence that means to destroy it. And with nowhere else to turn, Richard Mayhew must now join the Lady Door\u0027s entourage in their determined--and possibly fatal--quest.\nFor the dread journey ever-downward--through bizarre anachronisms and dangerous incongruities, and into dusty corners of stalled time--is Richard\u0027s final hope, his last road back to a \u0022real\u0022 world that is growing disturbingly less real by the minute.\nIf Tim Burton reimagined The Phantom of the Opera, if Jack Finney let his dark side take over, if you rolled the best work of Clive Barker, Peter Straub and Caleb Carr into one, you still would have something that fell far short of Neil Gaiman\u0027s NEVERWHERE. It is a masterful debut novel of darkly hypnotic power, and one of the most absorbing reads to come along in years.",

Spectacular inventions from the farthest reaches of space and deep beneath the earth are available to meet every need, providing antidotes to individual troubles and social ills. Inventors are highly prized and respected, and they are jealously protected and lavishly cared for by world governments. That support and acclaim, however\u2014as the most brilliant of scientists, Ralph 124C 41\u002B, discovers\u2014is not without its price. This visionary novel of the twenty-seventh century was written by Hugo Gernsback (1887\u20131964), founder of the influential magazine Amazing Stories. Marvelously prophetic and creative, Ralph 124C 41\u002B celebrates technological advances and entrances readers with an exuberant, unforgettable vision of what our world might become. This commemorative edition makes this landmark tale widely available for the first time in decades and features the prized Frank R. Paul illustrations from the rare first edition, a list of inventions and technological devices, and Hugo Gernsback\u0027s prefaces to the first and second editions.",

Mona\u0027s pimp sells her to a plastic surgeon in New York and she\u0027s turned overnight into someone else. The pimp winds up dead. Mona weeps for him. She\u0027s a sweet, dumb girl! so far.  Angie the famous Hollywood stim star has started remembering things. Despite the efforts of studio bosses to keep her in ignorance, Angie will discover who she really is! and why she doesn\u0027t need to jack into the Matrix in order to enter cyberspace.  In the depths of the rustbelt, the ring of steel garbage and toxic waste surrounding the Sprawl, Gentry obsessively seeks the darkest secrets of the Matrix. Seeking rapture.  When an impossibly tall and powerful skyscraper of data appears suddenly in the landscape of the Matrix, Gentry is ready for it, Angie is part of it, and Mona is set for overdrive. Rapture is on the agenda for all three, but others greedy for money and power will fight them to the death.",

Dick Award. With Neuromancer, William Gibson introduced the world to cyberspace--and science fiction has never been the same. Case was the hottest computer cowboy cruising the information superhighway--jacking his consciousness into cyberspace, soaring through tactile lattices of data and logic, rustling encoded secrets for anyone with the money to buy his skills. Then he double-crossed the wrong people, who caught up with him in a big way--and burned the talent out of his brain, micron by micron. Banished from cyberspace, trapped in the meat of his physical body, Case courted death in the high-tech underworld. Until a shadowy conspiracy offered him a second chance--and a cure--for a price....",

    "Description": "\u003Cp\u003EA tribe is any group of people, large or small, who are connected to one another, a leader, and an idea. For millions of years, humans have been seeking out tribes, be they religious, ethnic, economic, political, or even musical (think of the Deadheads). It\u0092s our nature. Now the Internet has eliminated the barriers of geography, cost, and time. All those blogs and social networking sites are helping existing tribes get bigger. But more important, they\u0092re enabling countless new tribes to be born\u0097groups of ten or ten thousand or ten million who care about their iPhones, or a political campaign, or a new way to fight global warming. And so the key question: Who is going to lead us? The Web can do amazing things, but it can\u0092t provide leadership. That still has to come from individuals\u0097 people just like you who have passion about something. The explosion in tribes means that anyone who wants to make a difference now has the tools at her fingertips. If you think leadership is for other people, think again\u0097leaders come in surprising packages. Consider Joel Spolsky and his international tribe of scary-smart software engineers. Or Gary Vaynerhuck, a wine expert with a devoted following of enthusiasts. Chris Sharma leads a tribe of rock climbers up impossible cliff faces, while Mich Mathews, a VP at Microsoft, runs her internal tribe of marketers from her cube in Seattle. All they have in common is the desire to change things, the ability to connect a tribe, and the willingness to lead. If you ignore this opportunity, you risk turning into a \u0093sheepwalker\u0094\u0097someone who fights to protect the status quo at all costs, never asking if obedience is doing you (or your organization) any good. Sheepwalkers don\u0092t do very well these days. Tribes will make you think (really think) about the opportunities in leading your fellow employees, customers, investors, believers, hobbyists, or readers. . . . It\u0092s not easy, but it\u0092s easier than you think.\u003C/p\u003E",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nThinner, bigger, faster, stronger... which 150 pages will you read? Is it possible to: Reach your genetic potential in 6 months? Sleep 2 hours per day and perform better than on 8 hours? Lose more fat than a marathoner by bingeing?   Indeed, and much more. This is not just another diet and fitness book.  The 4-Hour Body is the result of an obsessive quest, spanning more than a decade, to hack the human body. It contains the collective wisdom of hundreds of elite athletes, dozens of MDs, and thousands of hours of jaw-dropping personal experimentation. From Olympic training centers to black-market laboratories, from Silicon Valley to South Africa, Tim Ferriss, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The 4-Hour Workweek, fixated on one life-changing question:   For all things physical, what are the tiniest changes that produce the biggest results?  Thousands of tests later, this book contains the answers for both men and women.  From the gym to the bedroom, it\u2019s all here, and it all works.    YOU WILL LEARN (in less than 30 minutes each): How to lose those last 5-10 pounds (or 100\u002B pounds) with odd combinations of food and safe chemical cocktails. * How to prevent fat gain while bingeing (X-mas, holidays, weekends) * How to increase fat-loss 300% with a few bags of ice * How Tim gained 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days, without steroids, and in four hours of total gym time * How to sleep 2 hours per day and feel fully rested * How to produce 15-minute female orgasms * How to triple testosterone and double sperm count* How to go from running 5 kilometers to 50 kilometers in 12 weeks * How to reverse \u201Cpermanent\u201D injuries * How to add 150\u002B pounds to your lifts in 6 months * How to pay for a beach vacation with one hospital visit          And that\u0027s just the tip of the iceberg.  There are more than 50 topics covered, all with real-world experiments, many including more than 200 test subjects.  You don\u0027t need better genetics or more discipline. You need immediate results that compel you to continue.  That\u2019s exactly what The 4-Hour Body delivers.From the Hardcover edition.",

When the box was all but empty, the only thing that remained was hope. Now some of fantasy\u0027s finest writers have taken on the task of opening Pandora\u0027s closet. It is naturally chock full of an assortment of items, including a ring that can bring its wearer infinite health, a special helmet found in the most unlikely of places, a mysterious box that holds a legendary piece of cloth, and a red hoodie that transforms a woman\u0027s world. These stories are of items claimed by people, but only at their own peril. After indulging in these stories, readers will certainly look at their own closets in a whole new light.",

    "Description": "\u003Ch3\u003EFrom Library Journal\u003C/h3\u003E \u003Cp\u003EThis review is based on the galley issued by Ellis\u0027s original publisher, Simon \u0026amp; Schuster, before it cancelled the book. The book is now going through the editing process at Vintage. There may be some changes in the final version. The indignant attacks on Ellis\u0027s third novel (see News, p. 17; Editorial, p. 6) will make it difficult for most readers to judge it objectively. Although the book contains horrifying scenes, they must be read in the context of the book as a whole; the horror does not lie in the novel itself, but in the society it reflects. In the first third of the book, Pat Bateman, a 26-year-old who works on Wall Street, describes his designer lifestyle in excruciating detail. This is a world in which the elegance of a business card evokes more emotional response than the murder of a child. Then suddenly, for no apparent reason, Bateman calmly and deliberately blinds and stabs a homeless man. From here, the body count builds, as he kills a male acquaintance and sadistically tortures and murders two prostitutes, an old girlfriend, and a child he passes in the zoo. The recital of the brutalization is made even more horrible by the first-person narrator\u0027s delivery: flat, matter-of-fact, as impersonal as a car parts catalog. The author has carefully constructed the work so that the reader has no way to understand this killer\u0027s motivations, making it even more frightening. If these acts cannot be explained, there is no hope of protection from such random, senseless crimes. This book is not pleasure reading, but neither is it pornography. It is a serious novel that comments on a society that has become inured to suffering.

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\n\u0027One of the most disturbing novels I\u0027ve read in a long time. It possesses an unnerving air of documentary reality\u0027 - Michiko Kakutani, \u0022New York Times\u0022. In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with his debut novel, \u0022Less Than Zero\u0022. Published when he was just twenty-one, this extraordinary and instantly infamous work has done more than simply define a genre, it has become a rare thing: a cult classic and a timeless embodiment of the zeitgeist. Twenty-five years on, \u0022Less Than Zero\u0022 continues to be a landmark in the lives of successive generations of readers across the globe. Filled with relentless drinking in seamy bars and glamorous nightclubs, wild, drug-fuelled parties, and dispassionate sexual encounters, \u0022Less Than Zero\u0022 - narrated by Clay, an eighteen-year-old student returning home to Los Angeles for Christmas - is a fierce coming-of-age story, justifiably celebrated for its unflinching depiction of hedonistic youth, its brutal portrayal of the inexorable consequences of such moral depravity, and its author\u0027s refusal to condone or chastise such behaviour. \u0027An extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 - \u0022New Yorker\u0022.  \u0027The Catcher in the Rye for the MTV generation\u0027 - \u0022USA Today\u0022. \u0027Remarkable. A killer - sexy, sassy, sad\u0027 - \u0022Village Voice\u0022.",

This edition contains an Introduction written for the 1974 edition and updated for the 1983 edition.     This collection was among Ellison\u0027s first and it shows a writer with a wide-ranging imagination, ferocious creative energy, devastating wit and an eye for the wonderful and terrifying and tragic.     Among the gems are \u0022All The Sounds of Fear\u0022, \u0022The Sky is Burning\u0022, \u0022The Very Last Day of a Good Woman\u0022 and \u0022In Lonely Lands\u0022.

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nGeorge Griffith (1857-1906) was a prolific British science fiction writer and noted explorer who wrote during the late Victorian and Edwardian age. Many of his visionary tales appeared in magazines such as \u0022Pearson\u0027s Magazine\u0022 and \u0022Pearson\u0027s Weekly\u0022 before being published as novels. Griffith was extremely popular in the United Kingdom, though he failed to find similar acclaim in the United States, in part due to his revolutionary and socialist views. A journalist, rather than scientist by background, what his stories lack in scientific rigor and literary grace they make up for in sheer exuberance of execution. Although eternally overshadowed by H. G. Wells, Griffith\u0027s epic fantasies of romantic anarchists in a future world of war dominated by airship battlefleets and grandiose engineering provided a template for steampunk novels a century before the term was coined. The influence of books such as \u0022The Angel of the Revolution\u0022 and the character of Olga Romanoff on British fantasy writer Michael Moorcock is striking. The concept of revolutionaries imposing \u0022a \u0027pax aeronautica\u0027 over the earth,\u0022 at the center of Angel of the Revolution, was taken up by Wells many years later, in \u0022The Shape of Things to Come.\u0022 Though a less accomplished writer than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling or H.G. Wells, his novels were popular in their day and foreshadowed World War I and the Russian Revolutions and the concepts of the air to surface missile and VTOL aircraft. He wrote several tales of adventure set on contemporary earth, while \u0022The Outlaws of the Air\u0022 depicted a future of aerial warfare and the creation of a Pacific island utopia. Sam Moskowitz described him as \u0022undeniably the most popular science fiction writer in England between 1893 and 1895.\u0022\nEDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nCertain it should be that   beyond and about this World of Length   and Breadth   and Thickness   there is another World   or State of Existence   consisting of these and another dimension of which only those beings who are privileged to enter or dwell in it can have any conception.",

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nAud Torvingen is back-contemporary fiction\u0027s toughest, most emotionally complicated noir hero returns to teach a new round of lessons in hard-hitting justice, and to confront new adversaries: her own vulnerability and desire.    \n\nThe steely shell of Nicola Griffith\u0027s seemingly indomitable protagonist Aud Torvingen appears to be cracking. The six-foot-tall fury (who proved in *The Blue Place* and *Stay* that she can kill you as easily as look at you) is shaken by the shocking consequences of the self-defense class she\u0027s been teaching, and her investigation of what seems to be run-of-the-mill real-estate fraud is turning out to be more than she bargained for.    \n\n*Always* brilliantly intertwines the dramatic episodes of Aud\u0027s class with the increasingly complicated investigation that introduces Aud to the limits of self-reliance, and to the scary and beautiful prospect of allowing oneself to depend on other people. What emerges is a thrilling, thoroughly engrossing novel that imbues Griffith\u0027s \u0022classic noir hero\u0022 (*The New York Times Book Review*) with an emotional complexity that far exceeds the boundaries of the genre, and will push Griffith to her well-deserved place at the front rank of new-wave literary crime writers.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nUnder Andy Grove\u0027s leadership, Intel has become the world\u0027s largest chipmaker, the fifth-most-admired company in America, and the seventh-most-profitable company among the Fortune 500. You don\u0027t achieve rankings like these unless you have mastered a rare understanding of the art of business and an unusual way with its practice.Few CEOs can claim this level of consistent record-breaking success. Grove attributes much of this success to the philosophy and strategy he reveals in Only the Paranoid Survive--a book that is unique in leadership annals for offering a bold new business measure, and for taking the reader deep inside the workings of a major corporation. Grove\u0027s contribution to business thinking concerns a new way of measuring the nightmare moment every leader dreads--the moment when massive change occurs and all bets are off. The success you had the day before is gone, destroyed by unforeseen changes that hit like a stage-six rapid. Grove calls such moments Strategic Inflection Points, and he has lived through several. When SlPs hit, all rules of business shift fast, furiously, and forever. SlPs can be set off by almost anything--megacompetition, an arcane change in regulations, or a seemingly modest change in technology.Yet in the watchful leader\u0027s hand, SlPs can be an ace. Managed right, a company can turn a SIP into a positive force to win in the marketplace and emerge stronger than ever.To achieve that level of mastery over change, you must know its properties inside and out. Grove addresses questions such as these: What are the stages of these tidal waves? What sources do you turn to in order to foresee dangers before trouble announces itself? When threats abound, how do you deal with your emotions, your calendar, your career--as well as with your most loyal managers and customers, who may cling to tradition?No stranger to risk, Grove examines his own record of success and failure, including the drama of how he navigated the events of the Pentium flaw, which threatened Intel in a major way, and how he is dealing with the SIP brought on by the Internet. The work of a lifetime of reflection, Only the Paranoid Survive is a contemporary classic of leadership skills.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nIn the 1970s Joe Haldeman approached more than a dozen different publishers before he finally found one interested in The Forever War. The book went on to win both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, although a large chunk of the story had been cut out before it saw publication. Now Haldeman and Avon Books have released the definitive version of The Forever War, published for the first time as Haldeman originally intended. The book tells the timeless story of war, in this case a conflict between humanity and the alien Taurans. Humans first bumped heads with the Taurans when we began using collapsars to travel the stars. Although the collapsars provide nearly instantaneous travel across vast distances, the relativistic speeds associated with the process means that time passes slower for those aboard ship. For William Mandella, a physics student drafted as a soldier, that means more than 27 years will have passed between his first encounter with the Taurans and his homecoming, though he himself will have aged only a year. When Mandella finds that he can\u0027t adjust to Earth after being gone so long from home, he reenlists, only to find himself shuttled endlessly from battle to battle as the centuries pass. --Craig E. Engler",

    "Description": "**In this raucous collection of true-life stories, actress and comedian Chelsea Handler recounts her time spent in the social trenches with that wild, strange, irresistible, and often gratifying beast: the one-night stand.** You\u0027ve either done it or know someone who has: the one-night stand, the familiar outcome of a night spent at a bar, sometimes the sole payoff for your friend\u0027s irritating wedding, or the only relief from a disastrous vacation. Often embarrassing and uncomfortable, occasionally outlandish, but most times just a necessary and irresistible evil, the one-night stand is a social rite as old as sex itself and as common as a bar stool. Enter Chelsea Handler. Gorgeous, sharp, and anything but shy, Chelsea loves men and lots of them. My Horizontal Life chronicles her romp through the different bedrooms of a variety of suitors, a no-holds-barred account of what can happen between a man and a sometimes very intoxicated, outgoing woman during one night of passion. From her short fling with a Vegas stripper to her even shorter dalliance with a well-endowed little person, from her uncomfortable tryst with a cruise ship performer to her misguided rebound with a man who likes to play leather dress-up, Chelsea recalls the highs and lows of her one-night stands with hilarious honesty. Encouraged by her motley collection of friends (aka: her partners in crime) but challenged by her family members (who at times find themselves a surprise part of the encounter), Chelsea hits bottom and bounces back, unafraid to share the gritty details. My Horizontal Life is one guilty pleasure you won\u0027t be ashamed to talk about in the morning.",

Known as \u0022the broker,\u0022 Backman was a high roller--a lawyer making $10 million a year who could \u0022open any door in Washington.\u0022 That is, until he tried to broker a deal selling access to the world\u0027s most powerful satellite surveillance system to the highest bidder. When caught, Backman accepted prison as the one option that would keep him safe and alive, since the interested parties (the Israelis, the Saudis, the Russians, and the Chinese) were all itching to get their hands on his secrets at any cost. Little does he know that his own government has designs on accessing that information--or at least letting it die with him. Now, six years after his incarceration, the director of the CIA convinces a lame duck president to pardon Backman, and the broker becomes a free man--and an open target.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nAnne Harris\u0027s second novel welcomes readers to the Detroit of the future--a city of extreme poverty and extravagant wealth, were every life is overshadowed by the megalithic biotech corporation GeneSys. With the rise of maglev transportation and the death of the auto industry, the name Motor City has become an anachronism. There are no jobs except GeneSys jobs. One can either pass an exam and obtain an office job at GeneSys headquarters or work in the dangerous biopolymer-growing vats in Vattown. Chango Chichelski, a sport (a mutant from exposure to lethal growth medium in the vats) with a passionate love of the Detroit of her grandmother\u0027s stories, chooses instead to fall through the cracks. Chango lives in an ancient motor car and spends her time haunting (and committing to memory) buildings slated for demolition. Her life changes when she rescues, and then falls in love with, a fanged and four-armed sport named Helix. Helix is the adopted daughter of Hector Martin, the brilliant but emotionally unstable head scientist at GeneSys. Weary of her isolated life, Helix flees into Vattown, intending to become a vat diver. But her plan is opposed by Chango, whose union-organizer sister Ada died after contact with the vat\u0027s growth medium, and by the vat divers themselves, who refuse to accept a sport within their ranks. Accidental Creatures is an action-packed tale full of intrigue, betrayals, and flashy characters. Interestingly, the sports of the Vattown underworld--drug dealers, junk artists, and healers--look positively normal compared to GeneSys\u0027s corporate denizens, who scream, cry, fight, and lie outrageously to retain or advance their positions in the corporate hierarchy. Harris\u0027s writing style is not for everybody (for instance, readers allergic to comma splices should approach with caution). But for the less grammatically persnickety, Accidental Creatures may prove to be a rewarding tale of outsiders and identity. --Eddy Avery",

But a misplaced battleship\n\n               -in the wrong hands!\n\n               -can be most dangerous.\u0022 \n\n \n\n \n\nWHEN it comes to picking locks and cracking safes I admit to no master. The door to Inskipp\u0027s private quarters had an old-fashioned tumbler drum that was easier to pick than my teeth. I must have gone through that door without breaking step. Quiet as I was though, Inskipp still heard me. The light came on and there he was sitting up in bed pointing a .75 caliber recoilless at my sternum. \n\n\u0022You should have more brains than that, diGriz,\u0022 he snarled. \u0022Creeping into my room at night! You could have been shot.\u0022 \n\n\u0022No I couldn\u0027t,\u0022 I told him, as he stowed the cannon back under his pillow. \u0022A man with a curiosity bump as big as yours will always talk first and shoot later. And besides-none of this pussyfooting around in the dark would be necessary if your screen was open and I could have got a call through.\u0022 \n\nInskipp yawned and poured himself a glass of water from the dispenser unit above the bed. \u0022Just because I head the Special Corps, doesn\u0027t mean that I *am* the Special Corps,\u0022 he said moistly while he drained the glass. \u0022I have to sleep sometime. My screen is open only for emergency calls, not for every agent who needs his hand held.\u0022 \n\n\u0022Meaning I am in the hand-holding category?\u0022 I asked with as much sweetness as I could. \n\n\u0022Put yourself in any category you please,\u0022 he grumbled as he slumped down in the bed. \u0022And also put yourself out into the hall and see me tomorrow during working hours.\u0022 \n\nHe was at my mercy, really. He wanted sleep so much. And he was going to be wide awake so very soon. \n\n\u0022Do you know what this is?\u0022 I asked him, poking a large glossy pic under his long broken nose. One eye opened slowly. \n\n\u0022Big warship of some kind, looks like Empire lines. Now for the last time-go away!\u0022 he said. \n\n\u0022A very good guess for this late at night,\u0022 I told him cheerily. \u0022It is a late Empire battleship of the Warlord class. Undoubtedly one of the most truly efficient engines of destruction ever manufactured. Over a half mile of defensive screens and armament, that could probably turn any fleet existent today into fine radioactive ash-\u0022 \n\n\u0022Except for the fact that the last one was broken up for scrap over a thousand years ago,\u0022 he mumbled. \n\nI leaned over and put my lips close to his ear. So there would be no chance of misunderstanding. Speaking softly, but clearly. \n\n\u0022True, true,\u0022 I said. \u0022But wouldn\u0027t you be just a *little* bit interested if I was to tell you that one is being built today?\u0022 \n\nOh, it was beautiful to watch. The covers went one way and Inskipp went the other. In a single unfolding, in concerted motion he left the horizontal and recumbent and stood tensely vertical against the wall. Examining the pic of the battleship under the light. He apparently did not believe in pajama bottoms and it hurt me to see the goose-bumps rising on those thin shanks. But if the legs were thin, the voice was more than full enough to make up for the difference.\n\n",

It\u0027s not how much change \n\n               that signals danger, but how fast it\u0027s changing....\u0022 \n\n \n\nWE\u0027RE losing a planet, Neel. I\u0027m afraid that I can\u0027t ... understand it.\u0022 \n\nThe bald and wrinkled head wobbled a bit on the thin neck, and his eyes were moist. Abravanel was a very old man. Looking at him, Neel realized for the first time just how old and close to death he was. It was a profoundly shocking thought. \n\n\u0022Pardon me, sir,\u0022 Neel broke in, \u0022but is it possible? To lose a planet, I mean. If the readings are done correctly, and the k-factor equations worked to the tenth decimal place, then it\u0027s really just a matter of adjustment, making the indicated corrections. After all, Societics is an exact science-\u0022 \n\n\u0022Exact? *Exact!* Of course it\u0027s not! Have I taught you so little that you dare say that to me?\u0022 Anger animated the old man, driving the shadow of death back a step or two. \n\nNeel hesitated, feeling his hands quiver ever so slightly, groping for the right words. Societics was his faith, and his teacher, Abravanel, its only prophet. This man before him, carefully preserved by the age-retarding drugs, was unique in the galaxy. A living anachronism, a refugee from the history books. Abravanel had singlehandedly worked out the equations, spelled out his science of Societics. Then he had trained seven generations of students in its fundamentals. Hearing the article of his faith defamed by its creator produced a negative feedback loop in Neel so strong his hands vibrated in tune with it. It took a jarring effort to crack out of the cycle. \n\n\u0022The laws that control Societics, as postulated by ... you, are as exact as any others in the unified-field theory universe.\u0022 \n\n\u0022No they\u0027re not. And, if any man I taught believes that nonsense, I\u0027m retiring tomorrow and dropping dead the day after. My science-and it is really not logical to call it a science-is based on observation, experimentation, control groups and corrected observations. And though we have made observations in the millions, we are dealing in units in the billions, and the interactions of these units are multiples of that. And let us never forget that our units are people who, when they operate as individuals, do so in a completely different manner. So you cannot truthfully call my theories exact. They fit the facts well enough and produce results in practice, that has been empirically proven. So far. Some day, I am sure, we will run across a culture that doesn\u0027t fit my rules. At that time the rules will have to be revised. We may have that situation now on Himmel. There\u0027s trouble cooking there.\u0022 \n\n\u0022They have always had a high activity count, sir,\u0022 Neel put in hopefully.\n\n",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\n\u0022Science fiction is the characteristic literary genre of the century. It is the genre that stands in opposition to literary modernism.\u0022 So says David G. Hartwell in his introduction to The Science Fiction Century, an anthology spanning a hundred years of science fiction, from its birth in the 1890s to the future it predicted.David G. Hartwell is a World Fantasy Award-winning editor and anthologist who has twice before redefined a genre--first the horror field with The Dark Descent, then the subgenre of hard science fiction with The Ascent of Wonder, coedited with Kathryn Cramer. Now, Hartwell has compiled the mother of all definitive anthologies, guaranteed to change not only the way the science fiction field views itself but also the way the rest of literature views the field.The Science Fiction Century includes stories from the founding fathers of the field, such as H.G. Wells, C.S. Lewis, Jack London, and Rudyard Kipling; beloved mainstays of the genre, such as Philip Jos\u00E9 Farmer, Roger Zelazny, Jack Vance, and Poul Anderson; noted female writers, including Connie Willis, Nancy Kress, and James Tiptree, Jr.; and writers who have hit their stride in the last two decades, such as Bruce Sterling, William Gibson, Michael Swanwick, and James Morrow. Hartwell has also included writers widely recognized outside the genre, such as E.M. Forster, Michael Shaara, and John Crowley; and translations of foreign writers\u0027 formative works, including Dino Buzzati and Wolfgang Jeschke. This is must-have anthology for all literary interests.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nA never-before-published masterpiece from science fiction\u2019s greatest writer, rediscovered after more than half a century.When Joel Johnston first met Jinny Hamilton, it seemed like a dream come true. And when she finally agreed to marry him, he felt like the luckiest man in the universe. There was just one small problem. He was broke. His only goal in life was to become a composer, and he knew it would take years before he was earning enough to support a family. But Jinny wasn\u2019t willing to wait. And when Joel asked her what they were going to do for money, she gave him a most unexpected answer. She told him that her name wasn\u2019t really Jinny Hamilton---it was Jinny Conrad, and she was the granddaughter of Richard Conrad, the wealthiest man in the solar system.And now that she was sure that Joel loved her for herself, not for her wealth, she revealed her family\u2019s plans for him---he would be groomed for a place in the vast Conrad empire and sire a dynasty to carry on the family business.Most men would have jumped at the opportunity. But Joel Johnston wasn\u2019t most men. To Jinny\u2019s surprise, and even his own, he turned down her generous offer and then set off on the mother of all benders. And woke up on a colony ship heading out into space, torn between regret over his rash decision and his determination to forget Jinny and make a life for himself among the stars.He was on his way to succeeding when his plans--and the plans of billions of others--were shattered by a cosmic cataclysm so devastating it would take all of humanity\u2019s strength and ingenuity just to survive.\n",

    "Description": "\u003Cp\u003EThe core of this book is a systematic treatment of the historic transformation of the West from monarchy to democracy. Revisionist in nature, it reaches the conclusion that monarchy is a lesser evil than democracy, but outlines deficiencies in both. Its methodology is axiomatic-deductive, allowing the writer to derive economic and sociological theorems, and then apply them to interpret historical events.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA compelling chapter on time preference describes the progress of civilization as lowering time preferences as capital structure is built, and explains how the interaction between people can lower time all around, with interesting parallels to the Ricardian Law of Association. By focusing on this transformation, the author is able to interpret many historical phenomena, such as rising levels of crime, degeneration of standards of conduct and morality, and the growth of the mega-state. In underscoring the deficiencies of both monarchy and democracy, the author demonstrates how these systems are both inferior to a natural order based on private-property.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHoppe deconstructs the classical liberal belief in the possibility of limited government and calls for an alignment of conservatism and libertarianism as natural allies with common goals. He defends the proper role of the production of defense as undertaken by insurance companies on a free market, and describes the emergence of private law among competing insurers. Having established a natural order as superior on utilitarian grounds, the author goes on to assess the prospects for achieving a natural order. Informed by his analysis of the deficiencies of social democracy, and armed with the social theory of legitimation, he forsees secession as the likely future of the US and Europe, resulting in a multitude of region and city-states. This book complements the author\u0027s previous work defending the ethics of private property and natural order. \u003Cem\u003EDemocracy\u003C/em\u003E\u2014\u003Cem\u003EThe God that Failed \u003C/em\u003Ewill be of interest to scholars and students of history, political economy, and political philosophy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E**\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/html\u003E",

Through the most efficient scientific and psychological engineering, people are genetically designed to be passive and therefore consistently useful to the ruling class. This powerful work of speculative fiction sheds a blazing critical light on the present and is considered to be Aldous Huxley\u0027s most enduring masterpiece. The nonfiction work Brave New World Revisited, first published in 1958, is a fascinating work in which Huxley uses his tremendous knowledge of human relations to compare the modern-day world with his prophetic fantasy envisioned in Brave New World, including the threats to humanity, such as overpopulation, propaganda, and chemical persuasion.",

Led by General Nick Fury, the roster includes billionaire playboy Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man; Captain America, a World War II super-soldier whom fate has thrust into the twenty-first century; an environmental activist who claims to be the Norse god Thor; and Janet Pym, a scientist whose mutant powers allow her to shrink to the size of a wasp.The alien shapeshifters called the Chitauri were defeated by the Ultimates in a decisive battle, but suspicious activity leads the Ultimates to believe that not all of the aliens were destroyed in that cataclysmic attack. Stark Industries has developed a means of quickly and easily detecting Chitauri DNA, but the federal government refuses to adopt the technology, claiming that if the tech is widely available, the Chitauri will find a way to fool it.Frustrated by the government\u0027s seeming unwillingness to protect its own people, Captain America takes matters into his own hands, leaking the technology so that it can be manufactured and distributed throughout the country. His radical actions sow discord among the Ultimates and within the highest levels of government, raising a troubling question: Could this disunity and chaos be playing right into the Chitauri\u0027s hands?Meanwhile, Hank Pym, who desperately wants back on the Ultimates team, has been feverishly experimenting with his ants in the hopes of finding his own alternate method of detecting the Chitauri. When he appears to be successful, it could spell doom for the alien menace -- but only if the Ultimates can finally set aside their differences long enough to recognize their true enemy....",

Soon, Grace starts coming to the conclusion that Bishop has performed the apparently impossible feat of being in two places at once. Has someone stolen his identity, or is he simply a very clever liar? As Grace digs deeper behind the facade of the Bishops\u0027 outwardly respectable lives, it starts to become clear that all is not at all as it first seemed. And then he digs just a little too far, and suddenly the fragile stability of his own troubled, private world is facing destruction . . .

And now, too late to change her mind and get out, with the metal walls pressing in around her, they lunged sharply downwards.

I\u0101m not a violent person, even before Caitlin\u0101s influence, I never even liked killing flies in my kitchen.

As Superintendent Roy Grace investigates the recovered bodies, he unearths the trail of a gang of child traffickers operating from Eastern Europe.

Jacobs felt compelled to change his ways and get healthy. To accomplish this epic task, he consulted an army of experts and subjected himself to dozens of different workouts, diets, and devices\u2014from Finger Fitness to Strollercize sessions, veganism to extreme chewing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe story of his transformation is not only brilliantly entertaining, but it just may be the healthiest book ever written. It will make you laugh until your sides split and endorphins flood your bloodstream. It will move you emotionally and get you moving physically in surprising ways. It will serve you up today\u2019s best health advice. And it will give you occasion to reflect on the body\u2019s many mysteries and the ultimate pursuit of health: a well-lived life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EAmazon.com Review\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAmazon Best Books of the Month, April 2012\u003C/strong\u003E: You may know A.J. Jacobs as the man who attempted to read the \u003Cem\u003EEncyclopedia Britannica\u003C/em\u003E from cover-to-cover. Or you may have been introduced to him when he spent a year trying to follow the Bible as literally as possible. He returns once again with another seemingly impossible task--that of becoming the healthiest man alive. As with his earlier books, Jacobs brings his quick wit, self-deprecating humor, and journalistic eye to the experiment. He leaves no health stone unturned: from literally running his errands and wearing noise-cancelling headphones for hours a day to rigging a desk that he can work at while walking on the treadmill (there are instructions at the end for those interested), Jacobs chronicles the good, bad, and ugly of trying to attain \u201Cperfect\u201D health. Jacobs\u2019 writing is breezy, informational, and entertaining, and he manages to achieve the near impossible--discussing issues of health without sounding preachy. \u003Cem\u003E--Caley Anderson\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EReview\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A.J.

Nicknamed The Grandmother of Science  Fiction, or The Little Mother of Science Fiction, she burst onto the scene in 1948 with a  disturbing story about nuclear radiation. She was also a passionate social and political activist. In  fact, her life was a constant adventure within the alternative and experimental worlds of science  fiction, politics and literature.  She died in 1997.  Written by her granddaughter, this loving  memoir and biography is illustrated with  * original art works * covers from classic science  fiction magazines * period illustrations * personal and art photographs  Though Judith Merril\u0027s  classic books are now out-of-print, they are widely available in libraries and used book stores;  and first editions of her work are quite collectible.",

    "Description": "### From Publishers Weekly\n\nKawasaki (*Rules for Revolutionaries*) draws upon his dual background as an evangelist for Apple\u0027s Macintosh computer and as a Silicon Valley venture capitalist in this how-to for launching any type of business project. Each chapter begins with \u0022GIST\u0022 (\u0022great ideas for starting things\u0022), covering a variety of facets to consider, from identifying your customer base and writing a business plan to establishing partnerships and building brand identity. Minichapters zero in on particular jobs that will need doing, while FAQ sections address the questions readers are most likely to have: Kawasaki covers the basics in an effectively casual tone. Much of the advice, however, consists of generic banalities\u2014start your company\u0027s name with a letter that comes early in the alphabet, use big type in presentation slides for older businessmen with declining eyesight, and avoid writing e-mails in all capital letters\u2014that can be found in any mediocre guide. Fortunately, Kawasaki does rise to the occasion here and there. He goes into great detail when it comes to raising capital and offers effective methods for sorting through the nonsense associated with interviewing prospective employees.   \nCopyright \u00A9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nIn the seemingly paradisal Wisconsin town of French Landing, small distortions disturb the beauty: a talking crow, an old man obeying strange internal marching orders, a house that is both there and not quite there. And roaming the town is a terrible fiend nicknamed the Fisherman, who is abducting and murdering small children and eating their flesh. The sheriff desperately wants the help of a retired Los Angeles cop, who once collared another serial killer in a neighboring town. Of course, this is no ordinary policeman, but Jack Sawyer, hero of Stephen King and Peter Straub\u0027s 1984 fantasy The Talisman. At the end of that book, the 13-year-old Jack had completed a grueling journey through an alternate realm called the Territories, found a mysterious talisman, killed a terrible enemy, and saved the life of his mother and her counterpart in the Territories. Now in his 30s, Jack remembers nothing of the Talisman, but he also hasn\u0027t entirely forgotten: When these faces rise or those voices mutter, he has until now told himself the old lie, that once there was a frightened boy who caught his mother\u0027s neurotic terror like a cold and made up a story, a grand fantasy with good old Mom-saving Jack Sawyer at its center. None of it was real, and it was forgotten by the time he was sixteen. By then he was calm. Just as he\u0027s calm now, running across his north field like a lunatic, leaving that dark track and those clouds of startled moths behind him, but doing it calmly. Jack is abruptly pulled into the case--and back into the Territories--by the Fisherman himself, who sends Jack a child\u0027s shoe, foot still attached. As Jack flips back and forth between French Landing and the Territories, aided by his 20-years-forgotten friend Speedy Parker and a host of other oddballs (including a blind disk jockey, the beautiful mother of one of the missing children, and a motorcycle gang calling itself the \u0022Hegelian Scum\u0022), he tracks both the Fisherman and a much bigger fish: the abbalah, the Crimson King who seeks to destroy the axle of worlds. While The Talisman was a straightforward myth in 1980s packaging, Black House is richer and more complex, a fantasy wrapped in a horror story inside a mystery, sporting a clever tangle of references to Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe, jazz, baseball, and King\u0027s own Dark Tower saga. Talisman fans will find the sure-footed Jack has worn well--as has the King/Straub writing style, which is much improved with the passage of two decades. --Barrie Trinkle",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nWhy read Carrie? Stephen King himself has said that he finds his early work \u0022raw,\u0022 and Brian De Palma\u0027s movie was so successful that we feel like we have read the novel even if we never have. The simple answer is that this is a very scary story, one that works as well--if not better--on the page as on the screen. Carrie White, menaced by bullies at school and her religious nut of a mother at home, gradually discovers that she has telekinetic powers, powers that will eventually be turned on her tormentors. King has a way of getting under the skin of his readers by creating an utterly believable world that throbs with menace before finally exploding. He builds the tension in this early work by piecing together extracts from newspaper reports, journals, and scientific papers, as well as more traditional first- and third-person narrative in order to reveal what lurks beneath the surface of Chamberlain, Maine. News item from the Westover (ME) weekly Enterprise, August 19, 1966: \u0022Rain of Stones Reported: It was reliably reported by several persons that a rain of stones fell from a clear blue sky on Carlin Street in the town of Chamberlain on August 17th.\u0022 Although the supernatural pyrotechnics are handled with King\u0027s customary aplomb, it is the carefully drawn portrait of the little horrors of small towns, high schools, and adolescent sexuality that give this novel its power, and assures its place in the King canon. --Simon Leake",

When you read it again, you can pay more attention to the theme of country folk vs. city folk; the parallel marriage conflicts of the Cambers vs. the Trentons; the poignancy of the amiable St. Bernard (yes, the breed choice is just right) infected by a brain-destroying virus that makes it into a monster; and the way the \u0022daylight burial\u0022 of the failed ad campaign is reflected in the sunlit Pinto that becomes a coffin.

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nMore of a mystery than a horror novel, Dolores Claiborne contains only the briefest glances at the supernatural. The novel presents Stephen King as a writer experimenting with style and narrative, time and perspective. Fans looking for a skin-crawling, page-turning fright or an undead bloodbath will be disappointed, but a patient reader willing to savor King\u0027s leisurely study of character and island life will find many rewards. And all of this is not to say that the book is without suspense. The story unfolds in one continuous chapter, told in the first person by the cranky, 65-year-old housekeeper, Dolores, who is explaining to police officers and a stenographer how and why she killed her husband, Joe, 30 years ago. At the same time, in her rambling monologue, she insists that she did not kill her longtime employer, Vera Donovan--notwithstanding what the residents of Little Tall Island may be whispering. Joe was a drinker, and, as Dolores gradually argues, he deserved to die for the horrifying crimes he committed against his family. But Vera, despite her cantankerous disposition as a lady governing her decaying estate with her precise rules about even the most mundane household chore (\u0022Six pins! Remember to use six pins! Don\u0027t you let the wind blow my good sheets down to the corner of the yard!\u0022), was a good woman--or at least not an evil one. She was the woman who hired the young Dolores and kept her on even after Dolores got pregnant again. Dolores cleaned and cared for her even as the old matron faded into senility. Dolores Claiborne is a rich novel that recalls the regionalist writing of the turn of the century. It is a fine place for a skeptical newcomer--put off by King\u0027s reputation for outright terror--to start. And for fans, it is a book that offers new insights into an author who\u0027s an old favorite. --Patrick O\u0027Kelley",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nIn the fall of 1978 (between The Stand and The Dead Zone), Stephen King taught a course at the University of Maine on \u0022Themes in Supernatural Literature.\u0022 As he writes in the foreword to this book, he was nervous at the prospect of \u0022spending a lot of time in front of a lot of people talking about a subject in which I had previously only felt my way instinctively, like a blind man.\u0022 The course apparently went well, and as with most teaching experiences, it was as instructive, if not more so, to the teacher as it was to the students. Thanks to a suggestion from his former editor at Doubleday, King decided to write Danse Macabre as a personal record of the thoughts about horror that he developed and refined as a result of that course. The outcome is an utterly charming book that reads as if King were sitting right there with you, shooting the breeze. He starts on October 4, 1957, when he was 10 years old, watching a Saturday matinee of Earth vs. the Flying Saucers. Just as the saucers were mounting their attack on \u0022Our Nation\u0027s Capital,\u0022 the movie was suddenly turned off. The manager of the theater walked out onto the stage and announced, \u0022The Russians have put a space satellite into orbit around the earth. They call it ... Spootnik.\u0022 That\u0027s how the whole book goes: one simple, yet surprisingly pertinent, anecdote or observation after another. King covers the gamut of horror as he\u0027d experienced it at that point in 1978 (a period of about 30 years): folk tales, literature, radio, good movies, junk movies, and the \u0022glass teat\u0022. It\u0027s colorful, funny, and nostalgic--and also strikingly intelligent. --Fiona Webster",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nStephen King fans, rejoice! The bodysnatching-aliens tale Dreamcatcher is his first book in years that slakes our hunger for horror the way he used to. A throwback to It, The Stand, and The Tommyknockers, Dreamcatcher is also an interesting new wrinkle in his fiction. Four boyhood pals in Derry, Maine, get together for a pilgrimage to their favorite deep-woods cabin, Hole in the Wall. The four have been telepathically linked since childhood, thanks to a searing experience involving a Down syndrome neighbor--a human dreamcatcher. They\u0027ve all got midlife crises: clownish Beav has love problems; the intellectual shrink, Henry, is slowly succumbing to the siren song of suicide; Pete is losing a war with beer; Jonesy has had weird premonitions ever since he got hit by a car. Then comes worse trouble: an old man named McCarthy (a nod to the star of the 1956 film Invasion of the Body Snatchers) turns up at Hole in the Wall. His body is erupting with space aliens resembling furry moray eels: their mouths open to reveal nests of hatpin-like teeth. Poor Pete tries to remove one that just bit his ankle: \u0022Blood flew in splattery fans as Pete tried to shake it off, stippling the snow and the sawdusty tarp and the dead woman\u0027s parka. Droplets flew into the fire and hissed like fat in a hot skillet.\u0022 For all its nicely described mayhem, Dreamcatcher is mostly a psychological drama. Typically, body snatchers turn humans into zombies, but these aliens must share their host\u0027s mind, fighting for control. Jonesy is especially vulnerable to invasion, thanks to his hospital bed near-death transformation, but he\u0027s also great at messing with the alien\u0027s head. While his invading alien, Mr. Gray, is distracted by puppeteering Jonesy\u0027s body as he\u0027s driving an Arctic Cat through a Maine snowstorm, Jonesy constructs a mental warehouse along the lines of The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci. Jonesy physically feels as if he\u0027s inside a warehouse, locked behind a door with the alien rattling the doorknob and trying to trick him into letting him in. It\u0027s creepy from the alien\u0027s view, too. As he infiltrates Jonesy, experiencing sugar buzz, endorphins, and emotions for the first time, Jonesy\u0027s influence is seeping into the alien: \u0022A terrible thought occurred to Mr. Gray: what if it was his concepts that had no meaning?\u0022 King renders the mental fight marvelously, and telepathy is a handy way to make cutting back and forth between the campers\u0027 various alien battlefronts crisp and cinematic. The physical naturalism of the Maine setting is matched by the psychological realism of the interior struggle. Deftly, King incorporates the real-life mental horrors of his own near-fatal accident and dramatizes the way drugs tug at your consciousness. Like the Tommyknockers, the aliens are partly symbols of King\u0027s (vanquished) cocaine and alcohol addiction. Mainly, though, they\u0027re just plain scary. Dreamcatcher is a comeback and an infusion of rich new blood into King\u0027s body of work. --Tim Appelo",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nStephen King, an evil car, and a teenage boy coming to terms with the fragility and randomness of life.... Wait, haven\u0027t we read this before? Diehard King fans, worry not. Aside from the titular car playing a main role in the story, From a Buick 8 could not be less like King\u0027s 1983 masterpiece, Christine. If anything, this story resembles King\u0027s serial novel The Green Mile, with reminiscing police characters flashing back on bizarre events that took place decades earlier. The book\u0027s intriguing plot revolves around the troopers of Pennsylvania State Patrol Troop D, who come into possession of what at first appears to be a vintage automobile. Closer inspection and experimentation conducted by the troopers reveal that this car\u0027s doors (and trunk) sometimes open to another dimension populated by gross-out creatures straight out of ... well, a Stephen King novel. As the plot progresses, the veteran troopers\u0027 tales of these visits from interdimensional nasties, and the occasional \u0022lightquakes\u0022 put on by the car, are passed on to the son of a fallen comrade whose fascination with the car bordered on dangerous obsession. Unlike earlier King works, there is no active threat here; no monster is stalking the heroes of the story, unless you count the characters\u0027 own curiosity. In past books, King has terrorized readers with vampires, werewolves, a killer clown, ghosts, and aliens, but this time around, the bogeyman is a more passive, cerebral threat, and one for which they don\u0027t make a ready-to-wear Halloween costume--man\u0027s fascination with and fear of the unknown. While some readers may find this tale less exciting than the horror master\u0027s earlier works, From a Buick 8 is a wonderful example of how much King\u0027s plotting skills and literary finesse have matured over his long career. And, most of all, it\u0027s a darn creepy book. --Benjamin Reese",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nStephen King\u0027s collection of five stories about \u002760s kids reads like a novel. The best is \u0022Low Men in Yellow Coats,\u0022 about Bobby Garfield of Harwich, Connecticut, who craves a Schwinn for his 11th birthday. But his widowed mom is impoverished, and so bitter that she barely loves him. King is as good as Spielberg or Steven Millhauser at depicting an enchanted kid\u0027s-eye view of the world, and his Harwich is realistically luminous to the tiniest detail: kids bashing caps with a smoke-blackened rock, a car grille \u0022like the sneery mouth of a chrome catfish,\u0022 a Wild Mouse carnival ride that makes kids \u0022simultaneously sure they were going to live forever and die immediately.\u0022 Bobby\u0027s mom takes in a lodger, Ted Brautigan, who turns the boy on to great books like Lord of the Flies. Unfortunately, Ted is being hunted by yellow-jacketed men--monsters from King\u0027s Dark Tower novels who take over the shady part of town. They close in on Ted and Bobby, just as a gang of older kids menace Bobby and his girlfriend, Carol. This pointedly echoes the theme of Lord of the Flies (the one book King says he wishes he\u0027d written): war is the human condition. Ted\u0027s mind-reading powers rub off a bit on Bobby, granting nightmare glimpses of his mom\u0027s assault by her rich, vile, jaunty boss. King packs plenty into 250 pages, using the same trick Bobby discerns in the film Village of the Damned: \u0022The people seemed like real people, which made the make-believe parts scarier.\u0022 Vietnam is the otherworldly horror that haunts the remaining four stories. In the title tale, set in 1966, University of Maine college kids play the card game Hearts so obsessively they risk flunking out and getting drafted. The kids discover sex, rock, and politics, become war heroes and victims, and spend the \u002780s and \u002790s shell-shocked by change. The characters and stories are crisscrossed with connections that sometimes click and sometimes clunk. The most intense Hearts player, Ronnie Malenfant (\u0022evil infant\u0022), perpetrates a My Lai-like atrocity; a nice Harwich girl becomes a radical bomber. King\u0027s metaphor for lost \u002760s innocence is inspired by Donovan\u0027s \u0022sweet and stupid\u0022 song about the sunken continent, and his stories hail the vanished Atlantis of his youth with deep sweetness and melancholy intelligence. --Tim Appelo",

Stephen King disagrees: \u0022My deeply held conviction is that story must be paramount.... All other considerations are secondary--theme, mood, even characterization and language.\u0022 These fine stories, each written in what King calls \u0022a burst of faith, happiness, and optimism,\u0022 prove his point. The theme, mood, characters, and language vary, but throughout, a sense of story reigns supreme. Nightmares \u0026 Dreamscapes contains 20 short tales--including several never before published--plus one teleplay, one poem, and one nonfiction piece about kids and baseball that appeared in the New Yorker. The subjects include vampires, zombies, an evil toy, man-eating frogs, the burial of a Cadillac, a disembodied finger, and a wicked stepfather. The style ranges from King\u0027s well-honed horror to a Ray Bradbury-like fantasy voice to an ambitious pastiche of Raymond Chandler and Ross MacDonald. And like a compact disc with a bonus track, the book ends with a charming little tale not listed in the table of contents--a parable called \u0022The Beggar and the Diamond.\u0022 --Fiona Webster",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nIn Misery (1987), as in The Shining (1977), a writer is trapped in an evil house during a Colorado winter. Each novel bristles with claustrophobia, stinging insects, and the threat of a lethal explosion. Each is about a writer faced with the dominating monster of his unpredictable muse. Paul Sheldon, the hero of Misery, sees himself as a caged parrot who must return to Africa in order to be free. Thus, in the novel within a novel, the romance novel that his mad captor-nurse, Annie Wilkes, forces him to write, he goes to Africa--a mysterious continent that evokes for him the frightening, implacable solidity of a woman\u0027s (Annie\u0027s) body. The manuscript fragments he produces tell of a great Bee Goddess, an African queen reminiscent of H. Rider Haggard\u0027s She. He hates her, he fears her, he wants to kill her; but all the same he needs her power. Annie Wilkes literally breathes life into him. Misery touches on several large themes: the state of possession by an evil being, the idea that art is an act in which the artist willingly becomes captive, the tortured condition of being a writer, and the fears attendant to becoming a \u0022brand-name\u0022 bestselling author with legions of zealous fans. And yet it\u0027s a tight, highly resonant echo chamber of a book--one of King\u0027s shortest, and best novels ever. --Fiona Webster",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nStephen King The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah with 10 full-color illustrations by Darrel Anderson The next-to-last novel in Stephen King\u0027s seven-volume magnum opus, Song of Susannah is at once a book of revelation, a fascinating key to the unfolding mystery of the Dark Tower, and a fast-paced story of double-barreled suspense. To give birth to her \u0022chap,\u0022 demon-mother Mia has usurped the body of Susannah Dean and used the power of Black Thirteen to transport to New York City in the summer of 1999. The city is strange to Susannah...and terrifying to the \u0022daughter of none,\u0022 who shares her body and mind. Saving the Tower depends not only on rescuing Susannah but also on securing the vacant lot Calvin Tower owns before he loses it to the Sombra Corporation. Enlisting the aid of Manni senders, the remaining katet climbs to the Doorway Cave...and discovers that magic has its own mind. It falls to the boy, the billy-bumbler, and the fallen priest to find Susannah-Mia, who, in a struggle to cope -- with each other and with an alien environment -- \u0022go todash\u0022 to Castle Discordia on the border of End-World. In that forsaken place, Mia reveals her origins, her purpose, and her fierce desire to mother whatever creature the two of them have carried to term. Eddie and Roland, meanwhile, tumble into western Maine in the summer of 1977, a world that should be idyllic but isn\u0027t. For one thing, it is real, and the bullets are flying. For another, it is inhabited by the author of a novel called \u0027Salem\u0027s Lot, a writer who turns out to be as shocked by them as they are by him. These are the simple vectors of a story rich in complexity and conflict. Its dual climaxes, one at the entrance to a deadly dining establishment and the other appended to the pages of a writer\u0027s journal, will leave readers gasping for the saga\u0027s final volume (which, Dear Reader, follows soon, say thank ya).",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nWhen Stephen King originally wrote The Green Mile as a series of six novellas, he didn\u0027t even know how the story would turn out. And it turned out to be of his finest yarns, tapping into what he does best: character-driven storytelling. The setting is the small \u0022death house\u0022 of a Southern prison in 1932. The Green Mile is the hall with a floor \u0022the color of tired old limes\u0022 that leads to \u0022Old Sparky\u0022 (the electric chair). The charming narrator is an old man, a prison guard, looking back on the events decades later. Maybe it\u0027s a little too cute (there\u0027s a smart prison mouse named Mr. Jingles), maybe the pathos is laid on a little thick, but it\u0027s hard to resist the colorful personalities and simple wonders of this supernatural tale. And it\u0027s not a bad choice for giving to someone who doesn\u0027t understand the appeal of Stephen King, because the one scene that is out-and-out gruesome (it involves \u0022Old Sparky\u0022) can be easily skipped by the squeamish. The Green Mile won a 1997 Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel; and Tom Hanks stars in a film of the novel by Frank Darabont, the director of The Shawshank Redemption (from King\u0027s collection Different Seasons). --Fiona Webster",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nIn the St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost \u0026 Gothic Writers, Gary Westfahl predicts that \u0022King has already earned himself a place in the history of literature.... At the very least, he will enjoy the status of a latter-day Anthony Trollope, an author respected for his popularity and social commentary.... More likely, he will be enshrined as the Charles Dickens of the late 20th century, the writer who perfectly reflected, encapsulated, and expressed the characteristic concerns of his era.\u0022 If any of King\u0027s novels exemplifies his skill at portraying the concerns of his generation, it\u0027s The Dead Zone (1979). Although it contains a horrific subplot about a serial killer, it isn\u0027t strictly a horror novel. It\u0027s the story of an unassuming high school teacher, an Everyman, who suffers a gap in time--like a Rip Van Winkle who blacks out during the years 1970-75--and thus becomes acutely conscious of the way that American society is rapidly changing. He wakes up as well with a gap in his brain, the \u0022dead zone\u0022 of the title. The zone gives him crippling headaches, but also grants him second sight, a talent he doesn\u0027t want and is reluctant to use. The crux of the novel concerns whether he will use that talent to alter the course of history. The Dead Zone is a tight, well-crafted book. When asked in 1983 which of his novels so far was \u0022the best,\u0022 Stephen King answered, \u0022The one that I think works the best is Dead Zone. It\u0027s the one that [has] the most story.\u0022 --Fiona Webster",

As night falls, Trisha has only her ingenuity as a defense against the elements, and only her courage and faith to withstand her mounting fears. For solace she tunes her Walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox baseball games and follows the gritty performances of her hero, relief pitcher Tom Gordon. And when her radio\u0027s reception begins to fade, Trisha imagines that Tom Gordon is with her -- protecting her from an all-too-real enemy who has left a trail of slaughtered animals and mangled trees in the dense, dark woods....",

This tale of a troubled man hired to care for a remote mountain resort over the winter, his loyal wife, and their uniquely gifted son slowly but steadily unfolds as secrets from the Overlook Hotel\u0027s past are revealed, and the hotel itself attempts to laim the very souls of the Torrence family.

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nIn 1978, science fiction writer Spider Robinson wrote a scathing review of The Stand in which he exhorted his readers to grab strangers in bookstores and beg them not to buy it. The Stand is like that. You either love it or hate it, but you can\u0027t ignore it. Stephen King\u0027s most popular book, according to polls of his fans, is an end-of-the-world scenario: a rapidly mutating flu virus is accidentally released from a U.S. military facility and wipes out 99 and 44/100 percent of the world\u0027s population, thus setting the stage for an apocalyptic confrontation between Good and Evil. \u0022I love to burn things up,\u0022 King says. \u0022It\u0027s the werewolf in me, I guess.... The Stand was particularly fulfilling, because there I got a chance to scrub the whole human race, and man, it was fun! ... Much of the compulsive, driven feeling I had while I worked on The Stand came from the vicarious thrill of imagining an entire entrenched social order destroyed in one stroke.\u0022 There is much to admire in The Stand: the vivid thumbnail sketches with which King populates a whole landscape with dozens of believable characters; the deep sense of nostalgia for things left behind; the way it subverts our sense of reality by showing us a world we find familiar, then flipping it over to reveal the darkness underneath. Anyone who wants to know, or claims to know, the heart of the American experience needs to read this book. --Fiona Webster",

Set in a world of extraordinary circumstances, filled with stunning visual imagery and unforgettable characters, The Dark Tower series is King\u0027s most visionary feat of storytelling, a magical mix of science fiction, fantasy, and horror that may well be his crowning achievement. In November 2003, the fifth installment, Wolves of the Calla, will be published under the imprint of Donald M. Grant, with distribution and major promotion provided by Scribner. Song of Susannah, Book VI, and The Dark Tower, Book VII, will follow under the same arrangement in 2004. With these last three volumes finally on the horizon, readers-countless King readers who have yet to delve into The Dark Tower and a multitude of new and old fantasy fans-can now look forward to reading the series straight through to its stunning conclusion. Viking\u0027s elegant reissue of the first four books ensures that for the first time The Dark Tower will be widely available in hardcover editions for this eager readership.",

She has secretly devised a surgical procedure that could   alter the lives of millions. When the beautiful and successful Valerie   Dalton walks into Fletcher\u0027s office for a routine abortion, the doctor   realizes that she has found the perfect experimental subject.    \n\nIn another room of the same clinic wait Karen Chandler and her husband,   who have sought pregnancy for years with no success. They greet   Fletcher\u0027s offer of a radically new embryo-implant procedure as a   miracle. Karen, with no hesitation, agrees to undergo the questionable   surgery.    \n\nWhen little Renata is born and then falls deathly ill, only one person can save her life. A woman who does not even know her   daughter exists. Under a barrage of media scrutiny, Valerie Dalton must   face the courts with her lover in an unprecedented custody battle.   Ultimately, she plumbs the depths of her shattered soul to find an   answer to the conflict that rages within her and all   society.    \n\n*Solomon\u0027s Knife* is a masterful and fiery mixture   of medical thriller and courtroom drama that fuses every facet of the   most violently debated issue of our age.

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nRoland Deschain and his ka-tet are bearing southeast through the forests of Mid-World, the almost timeless landscape that seems to stretch from the wreckage of civility that defined Roland\u0027s youth to the crimson chaos that seems the future\u0027s only promise. Followers of Stephen King\u0027s epic series know Roland well, or as well as this enigmatic hero can be known. They also know the companions who have been drawn to his quest for the Dark Tower: Eddie Dean and his wife, Susannah; Jake Chambers, the boy who has come twice through the doorway of death into Roland\u0027s world; and Oy, the Billy Bumbler. In this long-awaited fifth novel in the saga, their path takes them to the outskirts of Calla Bryn Sturgis, a tranquil valley community of farmers and ranchers on Mid-World\u0027s borderlands. Beyond the town the rocky ground rises towards the hulking darkness of Thunderclap, the source of a terrible affliction that is slowly stealing the community\u0027s soul. One of the town\u0027s residents is Pere Callahan, a ruined priest who, like Susannah, Eddie and Jake, passed through one of the portals that lead both into and out of Roland\u0027s world. As Father Callahan tells the ka-tet the astonishing story of what happened following his shamed departure from Maine in 1977, his connection to the Dark Tower becomes clear, as does the danger facing a single red rose in a vacant lot off Second Avenue in midtown Manhattan. For Calla Bryn Sturgis, danger gathers in the east like a storm cloud. The Wolves of Thunderclap and their unspeakable depredation are coming. To resist them is to risk all, but these are odds the gunslingers are used to, and they can give the Calla folken both courage and cunning. Their guns, however, will not be enough.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nIn the introduction to Skeleton Crew (1985), his second collection of stories, King pokes fun at his penchant for \u0022literary elephantiasis,\u0022 makes scatological jokes about his muse, confesses how much money he makes (gross and net), and tells a story about getting arrested one time when he was \u0022suffused with the sort of towering, righteous rage that only drunk undergraduates can feel.\u0022 He winds up with an invitation to a scary voyage: \u0022Grab onto my arm now. Hold tight. We are going into a number of dark places, but I think I know the way.\u0022 And he sure does. Skeleton Crew contains a superb short novel (\u0022The Mist\u0022) that alone is worth the price of admission, plus two forgettable poems and 20 short stories on such themes as an evil toy monkey, a human-eating water slick, a machine that avenges murder, and unnatural creatures that inhabit the thick woods near Castle Rock, Maine. The short tales range from simply enjoyable to surprisingly good. In addition to \u0022The Mist,\u0022 the real standout is \u0022The Reach,\u0022 a beautifully subtle story about a great-grandmother who was born on a small island off the coast of Maine and has lived there her whole life. She has never been across \u0022the Reach,\u0022 the body of water between island and mainland. This is the story that King fans give to their friends who don\u0027t read horror in order to show them how literate, how charming a storyteller he can be. Don\u0027t miss it. --Fiona Webster",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nWizard and Glass, the fourth episode in King\u0027s white-hot Dark Tower series, is a sci-fi/fantasy novel that contains a post-apocalyptic Western love story twice as long. It begins with the series\u0027 star, world-weary Roland, and his world-hopping posse (an ex-junkie, a child, a plucky woman in a wheelchair, and a talking dog-like pet named Oy the Bumbler) trapped aboard a runaway train. The train is a psychotic multiple personality that intends to commit suicide with them at 800 m.p.h.--unless Roland and pals can outwit it in a riddling contest. It\u0027s a great race, for the mind and pulse. Movies should be this good. Then comes a 567-page flashback about Roland at age 14. It\u0027s a well-marbled but meaty tale. Roland and two teen homies must rescue his first love from the dirty old drooling mayor of a post-apocalyptic cowboy town, thwart a civil war by blowing up oil tanks, and seize an all-seeing crystal ball from Rhea, a vampire witch. The love scenes are startlingly prominent and earthier than most romance novels (they kiss until blood trickles from her lip). After an epic battle ending in a box canyon to end all box canyons, we\u0027re back with grizzled, grown-up Roland and the train-wreck survivors in a parallel world: Kansas in 1986, after a plague. The finale is a weird fantasy takeoff on The Wizard of Oz. Some readers will feel that the latest novel in King\u0027s most ambitious series has too many pages--almost 800--but few will deny it\u0027s a page-turner.",

Elsewhere he has argued that eliminating fat intake can prevent cancer; here, his quarry is the future of consciousness and intelligence. Humankind, it runs, is at the threshold of an epoch (\u0022the singularity,\u0022 a reference to the theoretical limitlessness of exponential expansion) that will see the merging of our biology with the staggering achievements of \u0022GNR\u0022 (genetics, nanotechnology and robotics) to create a species of unrecognizably high intelligence, durability, comprehension, memory and so on. The word \u0022unrecognizable\u0022 is not chosen lightly: wherever this is heading, it won\u0027t look like us. Kurzweil\u0027s argument is necessarily twofold: it\u0027s not enough to argue that there are virtually no constraints on our capacity; he must also convince readers that such developments are desirable. In essence, he conflates the wholesale transformation of the species with \u0022immortality,\u0022 for which read a repeal of human limit. In less capable hands, this phantasmagoria of speculative extrapolation, which incorporates a bewildering variety of charts, quotations, playful Socratic dialogues and sidebars, would be easier to dismiss. But Kurzweil is a true scientist\u2014a large-minded one at that\u2014and gives due space both to \u0022the panoply of existential risks\u0022 as he sees them and the many presumed lines of attack others might bring to bear. What\u0027s arresting isn\u0027t the degree to which Kurzweil\u0027s heady and bracing vision fails to convince\u2014given the scope of his projections, that\u0027s inevitable\u2014but the degree to which it seems downright plausible. \u003Cem\u003E(Sept.)\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cbr\u003ECopyright \u00A9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFrom\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurzweil is one of the world\u2019s most respected thinkers and entrepreneurs. Yet the thesis he posits in \u003Cem\u003ESingularity\u003C/em\u003E is so singular that many readers will be astounded\u2014and perhaps skeptical. Think \u003Cem\u003EBlade Runner \u003C/em\u003Eor \u003Cem\u003EBeing John Malkovich\u003C/em\u003E magnified trillion-fold. Even if one were to embrace his techno-optimism, which he backs up with fascinating details, Kurzweil leaves some important questions relating to politics, economics, and morality unanswered. If machines in our bodies can rebuild cells, for example, why couldn\u2019t they be reengineered as weapons? Or think of singularity, notes the \u003Cem\u003ENew York Times Book Review\u003C/em\u003E, as the \u0022Manhattan Project model of pure science without ethical constraints.\u0022 Kurzweil\u2019s vision requires technology, which we continue to build. But it also requires mass acceptance and faith.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECopyright \u00A9 2004 Phillips \u0026amp; Nelson Media, Inc.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003C/div\u003E",

Able to fight off periodical assaults and attempted takeovers in the past, they are losing ground technologically, and with no nearby allies they find themselves resorting to the unorthodox to improve their situation. Jonas Valent, a former engineer with the Freeground Fleet has reduced his professional life as a trade and supply agent, a not so glorified port traffic director. In his spare time he and his friends engage in anonymous combat with anyone who opposes them in station wide simulations. Their success rate and original thinking have earned them the attention of Freeground Fleet Command who have plans for the unsuspecting anonymous team. This book is about how it all began for Jonas and his friends. How they came together and took their first steps out into the galaxy.",

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nThe #1 New York Times bestseller: a brilliant account\u2014character-rich and darkly humorous\u2014of how the U.S. economy was driven over the cliff.  When the crash of the U. S. stock market became public knowledge in the fall of 2008, it was already old news. The real crash, the silent crash, had taken place over the previous year, in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn\u2019t shine, and the SEC doesn\u2019t dare, or bother, to tread: the bond and real estate derivative markets where geeks invent impenetrable securities to profit from the misery of lower- and middle-class Americans who can\u2019t pay their debts. The smart people who understood what was or might be happening were paralyzed by hope and fear; in any case, they weren\u2019t talking.    The crucial question is this: Who understood the risk inherent in the assumption of ever-rising real estate prices, a risk compounded daily by the creation of those arcane, artificial securities loosely based on piles of doubtful mortgages?  Michael Lewis turns the inquiry on its head to create a fresh, character-driven narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor, a fitting sequel to his #1 best-selling Liar\u2019s Poker. Who got it right? he asks. Who saw the real estate market for the black hole it would become, and eventually made billions of dollars from that perception? And what qualities of character made those few persist when their peers and colleagues dismissed them as Chicken Littles? Out of this handful of unlikely\u2014really unlikely\u2014heroes, Lewis fashions a story as compelling and unusual as any of his earlier bestsellers, proving yet again that he is the finest and funniest chronicler of our times.",

Excerpt from book:  Ill    THE old man wiped the tears away on his grimy knuckles and took up the tale in a tremulous, piping voice that soon strengthened as he got the swing of the narrative.    \u0022It was in the summer of 2013 that the Plague came. I was twenty-seven years old, and well do I remember it. Wireless despatches \u2014\u0022    Hare-Lip spat loudly his disgust, and Granser hastened to make amends.    \u0022We talked through the air in those days, thousands and thousands of miles. And the word came of a strange disease that had broken out in New York. There were seventeen millions of people living then in that noblest city of America. Nobody thought anything about the news. It was only a small thing. There had been only a few deaths. It seemed, though, that they had died very quickly, and that one of the first signs of the disease was the turning red of the face and all the body. Within twenty-four hours came the report of the first case in Chicago. And on the same day, it was made public that London, the greatest city in the world, next to Chicago, had been secretly fighting the plague for two weeks and censoring the news despatches \u2014 that is, not permitting the word to go forth to the rest of the world that London had the plague.    \u0022It looked serious, but we in California, like everywhere else, were not alarmed. We were sure that the bacteriologists would find a way to overcome this new germ, just asthey had overcome other germs in the past. But the trouble was the astonishing quickness with which this germ destroyed human beings, and the fact that it inevitably killed any human body it entered. No one ever recovered. There was the old Asiatic cholera, when you might eat dinner with a well man in the evening, and the next morning, if you got up early enough, you would see him being hauled by your windo...",

Now he surprises us again with an ambitious new thriller set in three realities at once, where three different lives hang in the balance\u2026.What if your world were rapidly running out of tomorrows? And what if the only way to save the future was to relive the past? But which past holds the key to survival? That\u2019s the life-and-death question faced by three desperate people separated by the past, present, and future but who share a single terrifying reality. A tortured soul, brain-damaged in a motorcycle accident, issues a pirate broadcast out of a van in near-future California. In Depression-era San Francisco an architect with an inoperable brain tumor seeks a mystical cure. A post-human space traveler caught in a cosmic accident searches for a way to reconstruct himself and the future. In Mark Budz\u2019s spellbinding narrative, their lives\u2013and deaths\u2013are drawn together by a force even more powerful than destiny.",

Political power has been grabbed by a few powerful families and their green saints. Millions of people are imprisoned in teeming cities; millions more labour on Pharaonic projects to rebuild ruined ecosystems. On the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, the Outers, descendants of refugees from Earth\u0027s repressive regimes, have constructed a wild variety of self-sufficient cities and settlements: scientific utopias crammed with exuberant creations of the genetic arts; the last outposts of every kind of democratic tradition. The fragile detente between the Outer cities and the dynasties of Earth is threatened by the ambitions of the rising generation of Outers, who want to break free of their cosy, inward-looking pocket paradises, colonise the rest of the Solar System, and drive human evolution in a hundred new directions. On Earth, many demand pre-emptive action against the Outers before it\u0027s too late; others want to exploit the talents of their scientists and gene wizards.Amid campaigns for peace and reconciliation, political machinations, crude displays of military might, and espionage by cunningly wrought agents, the two branches of humanity edge towards war . ..",

Past, present, and future Brazil, with all its color, passion, and shifting realities, come together in a novel that is part SF, part history, part mystery, and entirely enthralling. Three separate stories follow three main characters: Edson is a self-made talent impressario one step up from the slums in a near future S\u00E3o Paulo of astonishing riches and poverty. A chance encounter draws Edson into the dangerous world of illegal quantum computing, but where can you run in a total surveillance society where every move, face, and centavo is constantly tracked? Marcelina is an ambitious Rio TV producer looking for that big reality TV hit to make her name. When her hot idea leads her on the track of a disgraced World Cup soccer goalkeeper, she becomes enmeshed in an ancient conspiracy that threatens not just her life, but her very soul. Father Luis is a Jesuit missionary sent into the maelstrom of 18th-century Brazil to locate and punish a rogue priest who has strayed beyond the articles of his faith and set up a vast empire in the hinterland. In the company of a French geographer and spy, what he finds in the backwaters of the Amazon tries both his faith and the nature of reality itself to the breaking point. Three characters, three stories, three Brazils, all linked together across time, space, and reality in a hugely ambitious story that will challenge the way you think about everything.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nSean McMullen, frequent winner of Australia\u0027s top science fiction award, the Ditmar, has created a fascinating adventure through time in The Centurion\u0027s Empire. From A.D. 71 to 2029, the Roman centurion Vitellan hibernates through the centuries via an elixir made from snow-dwelling insects. Unfortunately, he doesn\u0027t possess the antidote for the corrosive substance, so every time he is awakened, his body is more ravaged. His frigidarium is secreted beneath an English village, and as the Danes invade during the Dark Ages, the villagers, in fear for their lives, awaken him. He teaches them Roman martial discipline and they fight off the Danish rabble, but he\u0027s so weak that he must return to his cold sleep and await better medicine in the future. He is awakened in 1358 to battle again, this time in France, but it\u0027s his next awakening--in 2028--that propels the latter half of the novel into a thrill ride of nanotech-embellished skullduggery, as Illuminati-like factions vie for control of the resurrected hero. The centurion\u0027s viewpoint offers both a window into history and a ledge to stand on while peering into the future. Readers who enjoy the juxtaposition of historical novel with science-fiction adventure, as in Ian McDonald\u0027s King of Morning, Queen of Day, will appreciate McMullen\u0027s expertise in The Centurion\u0027s Empire. --Blaise Selby",

Surrender or flight were the only options ... but not for Inspector Danolarian, his Wayfarer Constables, and his sweetheart, the sorceress Lavenci.Although Danolarian is no sorcerer, he\u0027s no ordinary Wayfarer either. Faced with civilization crumbling around him, and organized resistance shattered by the invincible magic of the Lupanians, he chances upon an unlikely ally and begins to fight back. It won\u0027t be easy, for he has to rally the demoralized sorcerers of Alberin, organize its terrified citizens, stay one step ahead of his own past, and, most importantly, survive a dinner party with Lavenci\u0027s mother.",

Here, in a city of the dead where desire is very much alive and murder a pleasure for connoisseurs, an honest cop must face his own darkest impulses just to have a prayer.There have been four victims already. Famed for their beauty and one-of-a-kind artistic gifts, they were murdered in the most shocking ways imaginable and their corpses stolen. Now the famed diva Maria daLivnova is arriving in Tristopolis\u2014a city literally powered by the massive necroflux generators that process the dead\u2014and it is up to Lieutenant Donal Riordan to make sure she ends her limited engagement alive.But Riordan isn\u2019t the only one watching deLivnova. For the Diva is being followed by two other secret \u201Cprotectors\u201D: Commander Laura Steele\u2014who\u2019s made a more or less successful transition to para-life\u2014and her partner, the invisible free-wraith Xalia. They are part of the necropolis\u2019s vast underground network and they\u2019ve mobilized against an unseen enemy for a battle of epic proportions. For a perverse death cult with powerful members in every stratum of society has learned how to distill from the bones of their sacrificed victims the ultimate thrill\u2014a nectar that, once tasted, is impossible to resist. And the more precious the life, the greater the pleasure it is to take it away.Soon Riordan will find himself in the unlikeliest of alliances as he journeys through a world of corruption\u2014both aboveground and below\u2014among gargoyles and zombies, spirit slaves and assassins, science and sorcery, in search of an enemy even the dead have every reason to fear\u2026.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nNew York Times bestselling author China Mi\u00E9ville delivers his most accomplished novel yet, an existential thriller set in a city unlike any other\u2013real or imagined.When a murdered woman is found in the city of Beszel, somewhere at the edge of Europe, it looks to be a routine case for Inspector Tyador Borl\u00FA of the Extreme Crime Squad. But as he investigates, the evidence points to conspiracies far stranger and more deadly than anything he could have imagined.Borl\u00FA must travel from the decaying Beszel to the only metropolis on Earth as strange as his own. This is a border crossing like no other, a journey as psychic as it is physical, a shift in perception, a seeing of the unseen. His destination is Beszel\u2019s equal, rival, and intimate neighbor, the rich and vibrant city of Ul Qoma. With Ul Qoman detective Qussim Dhatt, and struggling with his own transition, Borl\u00FA is enmeshed in a sordid underworld of rabid nationalists intent on destroying their neighboring city, and unificationists who dream of dissolving the two into one. As the detectives uncover the dead woman\u2019s secrets, they begin to suspect a truth that could cost them and those they care about more than their lives. What stands against them are murderous powers in Beszel and in Ul Qoma: and, most terrifying of all, that which lies between these two cities.Casting shades of Kafka and Philip K. Dick, Raymond Chandler and 1984, The City \u0026 the City is a murder mystery taken to dazzling metaphysical and artistic heights.From the Hardcover edition.",

Un Lun Dun is a place where words are alive, a jungle lurks behind the door of an ordinary house, carnivorous giraffes stalk the streets, and a dark cloud dreams of burning the world. It is a city awaiting its hero, whose coming was prophesied long ago, set down for all time in the pages of a talking book.When twelve-year-old Zanna and her friend Deeba find a secret entrance leading out of London and into this strange city, it seems that the ancient prophecy is coming true at last. But then things begin to go shockingly wrong.From the Hardcover edition.",

The Russians have stumbled onto a U.S. program for exploiting Thought Tunneling Devices (TTDs) found in alien tissue at a UFO crash site.     \n\nThe technology has sweeping implications for both the U.S. information economy and for Russia, struggling to find its way in the New World Order. At stake is TTD technology, whose power is revealed in the death of a Russian diplomat--devoured by rats on a Washington, D.C. street--and related computer code able to penetrate any networked computer system, no matter how \u0027secure.\u0027     \n\nWhen both spy and counter-spy are pursued by the same killers, they conspire to obtain the extraordinary evidence required to prove extraordinary claims--details of Project Ganymede that can only be found by penetrating a foreign technology test site at Groom Dry Lake Base, Nevada.     \n\nThe technology that threatens to restart the Cold War ultimately proves elusive, when both Washington and the Russians learn that TTDs tap into a galactic Internet, and the owners of the patent don\u0027t like intruders...    \n\nThe Ganymede Project is a gripping science-fiction technothriller, the movie rights to which have recently been optioned by The Woofenill Works, Inc.\n\n",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nJob\u0027s back on the old dung heap, and he wants a rematch with God. A Series-700 computer successfully reconstructs the tablets with the Ten Commandments from a million indecipherable shards - only to have second thoughts. Sheila, the lascivious sinner fished from the Flood by the captain of the Ark, has an agenda all her own. A congregation of sexless androids believes Darwin\u0027s theory of evolution applies to them and awaits the Great Genital Coming. And God justifies why he once beset mankind with an unusual plague. Why? Spare the rod, spoil the species, He says. (And He\u0027s always right. That\u0027s why He\u0027s got the job.). James Morrow unabashedly delves into matters both sacred and secular in this collection of stories buoyed by his deliciously irreverent wit. Among the dozen offerings is \u0022Bible Stories for Adults, No. 17: The Deluge,\u0022 winner of a Nebula Award for Best Short Story. Humorous, cheerfully blasphemous, and ultimately poignant, these tales show Morrow at his divine best.",

After being cut, this object collapses into four cylindrical pieces, each about the size of a tube train. Each is densely packed with either alien technology or some kind of life. They are placed for safety in three ozark cylinders of a massively secure space station. There a female research scientist subsequently falls pregnant, and gives birth to quads. Then she commits suicide - but why?   \n\n\n\n  By the end of the war one of the contesting planets has been devastated by the hilldiggers - giant space dreadnoughts employing weapons capable of creating mountain ranges. The quads have meanwhile grown up and are assuming positions of power in the post-war society. One of them will eventually gain control of the awesome hilldiggers.\n\n",

From 800 years in the future, a runcible gate is opened into the Polity and those coming through it have been sent specially to take the alien \u0027Maker\u0027 back to its home civilization in the Small Magellanic cloud. Once these refugees are safely through, the gate itself is rapidly shut down - because something alien is pursuing them. The gate is then dumped into a nearby sun. From those refugees who get through, agent Cormac learns that the Maker civilization has been destroyed by pernicious virus known as the Jain technology. This, of course, raised questions: Why was Dragon, a massive biocontruct of the Makers, really sent to the Polity? And, Why did a Jain node suddenly end up in the hands of someone who could do the most damage with it? Meanwhile an entity called the Legate is distributing pernicious Jain nodes ...and a renegade attack ship, The King of Hearts, has encountered something very nasty outside the Polity itself.",

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nEphram Korban was an admirer of the human creative spirit, dedicated to collecting art in its many forms--literature, photography, painting, and sculpture--before he took his own life. Nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains stands the home he built as a retreat for artists to hone their craft, perfect their skills...perhaps even produce a masterpiece. Isolated from the outside world in the electricity-free mansion, artists gather to court their muses for six weeks, undisturbed.      \n\nAnna Galloway has no interest in art and even less in the people who produce it. Her sensibilities are more in tune with the realm beyond the physical, where the souls of the deceased reside and visions reveal secrets. She has included herself among the elite artistes in residence at Korban\u0027s retreat because she has seen the manor in her dreams--and believes Korban\u0027s ghost may be wandering its halls.    \n\nNow, a blue moon is on the rise in October, opening magical pathways to conjure up something unimaginable. Something feeding off the energies of those in the house. Something seeking everlasting life--at any cost...\n\n",

The *John Glenn\u2019*s crew intended to terraform the nearly pristine planet Ymir, in hopes of creating a utopian society that will limit intelligent technology. \n\nBut by some miscalculation they have landed in another solar system, and extremely low on the antimatter needed to continue to Ymir, they must shape the nearby planet Harlequin\u2019s moon, Selene, into a new, temporary home. Their only hope of ever reaching Ymir is to rebuild their store of antimatter through decades of terraforming the moon. \n\nGabriel, the head terraformer, must lead this nearly impossible task, with all the wrong materials. His primary tools are the uneducated and nearly illiterate children of the original colonists, born and bred to build Harlequin\u2019s moon into a virtual antimatter factory. With no concept of the future and with life defined as duty, one girl, Rachel Vanowen, begins to ask herself the question: what will become of the children of Selene once the terraforming is complete.\n\n (20050916)\n\n",

Plus he has to walk past the red church every day, where the Bell Monster hides with its wings and claws and livers for eyes. But the biggest problem is that Archer McFall is the new preacher at the church, and Mom wants Ronnie to attend midnight services with her. Sheriff Frank Littlefield hates the red church for a different reason. His little brother died in a freak accident at the church twenty years ago, and now Frank is starting to see his brother\u0027s ghost. And the ghost keeps demanding, \u0022Free me.\u0022 People are dying in Whispering Pines, and the murders coincide with McFall\u0027s return. The Days, the Littlefields, and the McFalls are descendants of the original families that settled the rural Appalachian community. Those old families share a secret of betrayal and guilt, and McFall wants his congregation to prove its faith. Because he believes he is the Second Son of God, and that the cleansing of sin must be done in blood. \u0022Sacrifice is the currency of God,\u0022 McFall preaches, and unless Frank and Ronnie stop him, everybody pays.\n\n",

Against all odds the humans stopped them, and for five wars kept on stopping them.  With its violent expansion checked internal strains have built up within the Patriarchy, and now they threaten to tear it apart.  When the ambitious Kchula-Tzaatz makes a bid for ultimate power the established order comes tumbling down, and the flames of war burn hot in Destiny\u0027s Forge. Hammered on that Forge are; Major Quacy Tskombe, battle hardened warrior turned diplomat.  His life is duty, his mission takes him to the Citadel of the Patriarch in a last ditch effort to avert war.  When it all falls apart he\u0027s forced to choose between love and loyalty, with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance. Captain Ayla Cherenkova, starship commander.  As talented as she is beautiful, her hatred of the Kzinti has driven her to the top.   Her space combat genius is unmatched, but when she\u0027s trapped alone in the jungles of Kzinhome her survival will depend on a whole new skillset. Pouncer, First-Son-of-Meerz-Rritt, heir apparent to the galaxy\u0027s most powerful empire.  He\u0027s reduced to a nameless fugitive with the collapse of his father\u0027s dynasty.  Survival demands escape, but honor demands vengeance, and the price of his Name will be paid in the blood of worlds.\n\nPaul Chafe presents a masterpiece in the grand tradition of epic science fiction.  No fan of Larry Niven\u0027s best-selling Known Space series can miss Destiny\u0027s Forge.\n\n",

    "Description": "The colonists from Earth have spent a century in cold sleep to make the first journey, one way, to settle a planet in another solar system. Avalon seems perfect, a verdant, livable world still in its prehistoric age. The biologists and engineers who busy themselves planting and building scoff at the warnings of professional soldier Cadmann Weylanduntil a large, unnaturally fast and cunning predator begins stalking the colony. Learning how to kill the beast is only the first step, for they must then reevaluate their entire understanding of Avalon\u0027s ecology. The novel is best in its sympathetic treatment of the once formidable scientists who wake from cold sleep with impaired mental powers. \n",

For millionaire Tim Hamner, the comet is a ticket to immortality. For filmmaker Harvey Randall, it\u0027s a shot to redeem a flagging career. And for astronauts John Baker and Rick Delanty, it\u0027s a second chance for glory in outer space. But for a world gripped by comet fever, fascination quickly turns to fear. And only those who survive the impact will know the even greater terror, when rich and poor, politicians and killers, turn to each other or against each other--and the remnants of humanity grow savage to battle for what little remains . . .

Touched on in other accounts of the Man-Kzin wars, here for the first time is the decades-long saga of Wunderland: how the Wunderlanders first learned of the Kzin attacks on Earth by slower-than-light communications, barely in time to prepare to fight back. How the valiant human defenders turned to guerilla warfare in the Wunderland jungles and caves after the feline warrior race had destroyed or seized the cities. How, after the war ended in an ignominous defeat for the Kzin, some humans and Kzin worked for good will between the two species-their work complicated by humans wanting revenge and Kzin who still saw humans as a somewhat annoying food source. And how a human-Kzin team was sent to investigate a mysterious asteroid and found a threat not only to both species, but to the entire galaxy. The humans wanted to destroy it, but the Kzin wanted to exploit it, and the only hope was a Kzin telepath raised by humans from a cub. Which side would he choose, monkey or warcat?",

Then those feline lords of creation ran into those ridiculous weed-eating pacifistic apes who called themselves humans. And the catlike Kzin found they had their collective tail caught in a meat grinder. When the mighty Kzin moved in to take over the monkey-infested worlds, they got clobbered. The humans, with their underhanded monkey cunning, turned communications equipment and space drives into weapons that cut the dauntless Kzin heroes into ribbons. And then those underhanded humans gained a faster-than-light drive, and no amount of screaming and leaping could keep the Kzin from losing their first war in centuries of successful conquest. But you can\u0027t keep a good warcat down, and the Kzin have by no means given up. New weapons, new strategies, and new leaders.

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nThe kzin, formerly invincible conquerors of all they encountered, had a hard time dealing with their ignominious defeat by the leaf-eating humans. Some secretly hatched schemes for a rematch, others concentrated on gathering power within the kzin hierarchy, and some shamefully cooperated with the contemptible humans, though often for hidden motives. In war and in uneasy peace, kzin and humans continue their adventures, as told by Hal Colebatch, Paul Chafe, and Michael Joseph Harrington, expanding on the concepts created by New York Times best-selling writer Larry Niven.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nLarry Niven may be America\u0027s greatest living hard-SF writer. Much of his SF belongs to his famous future history, the Tales of Known Space. His preeminent creation is the Ringworld: an immense, artificial, ring-shaped planet that circles a Known Space star. Possibly SF\u0027s greatest feat of world-building, the Ringworld is featured in four novels: the Hugo and Nebula Award winner Ringworld (1970); The Ringworld Engineers (1980); The Ringworld Throne (1996); and Ringworld\u0027s Children (2004). Ringworld\u0027s Children returns series protagonist Louis Wu to the titular world. Louis and his friend The Hindmost, an alien of the Pierson\u0027s puppeteer race, are prisoners of the Ghoul protector Tunesmith, a Ringworld native, who is deliberately provoking the warships that surround his world. All the star-faring races of Known Space have sent warships to the Ringworld, and they are already at the brink of war. If fighting breaks out, the near-indestructible Ringworld will be destroyed: dissolved by antimatter weapons. The Ringworld series is so complex and ambitious that Ringworld\u0027s Children opens with a glossary and a cast of characters, inclusions that even many Known Space fans will need. Newcomers to Niven\u0027s artificial planet should start with Ringworld. --Cynthia Ward",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nLarry Niven and Jerry Pournelle have created a unique and believable world set in the universe of Niven\u0027s The Magic Goes Away. The story begins nearly 14,000 years ago in Tep\u0027s Town, located on the future site of Los Angeles. Tep\u0027s Town is a city held captive by the slumbering god of fire, Yagen-Atep. Awakening only occasionally, he commands selected men to begin Burnings by giving them the ability to start fires coupled with consuming anger. Whandall Placehold grows up in the stagnant, three-class society of Tep\u0027s town, part of a gang of thieves. No one gets in or out, since the town is hemmed in by a malevolent forest. But when Whandall is chosen by Yagen-Atep to start the Burnings, he resists the compulsion and, aided by Atlantean wizard Morth, escapes through the forest with a group of children he saves from certain death. As the years pass, Whandall builds an empire, buys wagons and bison, and builds a trade route all along the California coast--except for Tep\u0027s Town. Life is good for Whandall and his bride, Willow, until they get a message from a desperate Morth: he convinces Whandall to return to Tep\u0027s Town and help eradicate, once and for all, an ancient magical being from Atlantis who has been trying to kill Morth for many years. The Burning City is a lively book that deftly integrates social concerns of today with the magic and mythology of yesterday. Cameo appearances by the Native American god Coyote and the Norse god Loki add to the mischievous nature of the book. With a well-thought-out system of magic, characters with depth, unicorns, and swashbuckling adventure, this book is sure to please hardcore fantasy readers and fans of Niven and Pournelle. --Robert Gately",

There, 25 years have passed since humanity quarantined the mysterious aliens known as Moties within the confines of their own solar system. They have spent a quarter century analyzing and agonizing over the deadly threat posed by the only aliens mankind has ever encountered-- a race divided into distinct biological forms, each serving a different function. Master, Mediator, Engineer. Warrior. Each supremely adapted to its task, yet doomed by millions of years of evolution to an inescapable fate. For the Moties must breed-- or die.      And now the fragile wall separating them and the galaxy beyond is beginning to crumble.\n\n",

But what they weren\u0027t prepared for was the smoke ringan immense gaseous envelope that had formed around a neutron star directly in their path. The Smoke Ring was home to a variety of plant and animal life-forms evolved to thrive in conditions of continual free-fall. When Discipline encountered it, something went wrong.

No other intelligent beings have ever been encountered, not until a light sail probe enters a human system carrying a dead alien. The probe is traced to the Mote, an isolated star in a thick dust cloud, and an expedition is dispatched. In the Mote the humans find an ancient civilization--at least one million years old--that has always been bottled up in their cloistered solar system for lack of a star drive. The Moties are welcoming and kind, yet rather evasive about certain aspects of their society. It seems the Moties have a dark problem, one they\u0027ve been unable to solve in over a million years. This is the first collaboration between Niven and Pournelle, two masters of hard science fiction, and it combines Pournelle\u0027s interest in the military and sociology with Niven\u0027s talent for creating interesting, believable aliens. The novel meticulously examines every aspect of First Contact, from the Moties\u0027 biology, society, and art, to the effects of the meeting on humanity\u0027s economics, politics, and religions. And all the while suspense builds as we watch the humans struggle toward the truth. --Brooks Peck",

Dispatched by the all-powerful State on a mission of interstellar exploration and colonization, Discipline was aided (and secretly spied upon) by Sharls Davis Kendy, an emotionless computer intelligence programmed to monitor the loyalty and obedience of the crew. But what they weren\u0027t prepared for was the smoke ringan immense gaseous envelope that had formed around a neutron star directly in their path. The Smoke Ring was home to a variety of plant and animal life-forms evolved to thrive in conditions of continual free-fall. When Discipline encountered it, something went wrong. The crew abandoned ship and fled to the unlikely space oasis. Five hundred years later, the descendants of the Discipline crew living on the Smoke Ring no longer remember their origins. Earth is more myth than memory, and no recollection of the State remains. But Kendy remembers. And just outside the Smoke Ring, Discipline waits patiently to make contact with its wayward children.\nSUMMARY:\nIn the free-fall environment of the Smoke Ring, the descendants of the crew of the Discipline no longer remembered their Earth roots -- or the existence of Sharls Davis Kendy, the computer-program despot of the ship. Until Kendy initiated contact once more.Fourteen years later, only Jeffer, the Citizens Tree Scientist, knew that Kendy was still watching -- and waiting. Then the Citizens Tree people rescued a family of loggers and learned for the first time of the Admiralty, a large society living in free fall amid the floating debris called the Clump. And it was likely that the Admiralty had maintained, intact, Discipline\u0027s original computer library.Exploration was a temptation neither Jeffer nor Kendy could resist, and neither Citizens Tree nor Sharls Davis Kendy would ever be the same again...",

    "Description": "Xenocide The millennia-long saga of Andrew Wiggin called Ender, called The Speaker For the Dead called The Xenocide continues .... On the world Lusitania there are now three sapient races-the Pequeninos, who evolved there; Humans, who came to colonize; and a Hive Queen and her children brought by Ender long years ago. But on Lusitania there is also the descolada, a virus deadly to human beings which would spread like wildfire throughout the Stairways Congress should it ever escape the planet. The Starways Congress decided that The descolada should be wiped out once and for all, and sent a fleet, armed with a planet-destroying weapon, to do it. A fourth intelligence, loyal to Ender and Lusitania caused that fleet to disappear. On a distant world called Path live a people whose culture owes much to that of ancient China on Earth. They have evolved a caste known as the godspoken, people of superior intellectual abilities who pay a terrible price for their gifts. The godspoken of Path have given their loyalty and service to the Starways Congress. Among the god spoken is a young girl named, in The language of her people, Gloriously Bright. It is to her that the Starways Congress turn with the mystery of the disappearance of the Lusitania Fleet. There is no doubt that Gloriously Bright will discover the answer to the puzzle. The question is, what will she do with the information",

Duke Valens, of Civitas Vadanis, has a dilemma. He knows that his city cannot withstand the invading army; yet its walls are his only defence against the Mezentines. Perhaps the only way to save his people is to flee, but that will not be easy either.

But Ziani Vaatzes has his own concerns, and the fate of Civitas Vadanis may not be one of them.\u0022Intelligent and compassionate?it should be celebrated.\u0022 ?Interzone on Devices and Desires\u0022One of the most entertaining fantasy debuts in recent years? incredibly vivid, refreshing, fun, thoughtful, absorbing.\u0022 --SFX",

When his wife walks in on the thief, the situation quickly teeters out of control, leaving an empty safe and a lifeless body. The same night, a woman and her infant child are ruthlessly gunned down in an abandoned garage. The killer hasn\u0027t left a shred of evidence, except for a foreboding and cryptic message: WCF, the letters written in blood-red letters. With two elusive criminals on the loose, Detective Lindsay Boxer calls on the Women\u0027s Murder Club to help her stop them before they continue their spree. But before they can break either case, the Lipstick Killer changes his act and demands a ransom--not for a single victim, but for all of San Francisco. Lindsay puts her own life on the line--but will it be enough to save the city from this deranged killer?",

Aboard the floundering ship, Helfort is coming to grips with a painful injury and the unpleasant truth that nobody likes a young hero\u2013least of all senior officers.Without warning, the Ishaq and twenty-seven Fed merchant ships are blown apart in a horrific ambush, the first step in the Hammer\u2019s master strategy to destroy the hated Federated Worlds. Michael and a pitiful remnant of the Ishaq\u2019s crew escape the inferno. The Feds have no idea who\u2019s behind the heinous attack, and the Hammer are determined to keep it that way, consigning the Ishaq\u2019s survivors to a prison camp deep in the wilderness of the Hammer\u2019s home planet. No one\u2019s getting out alive to derail the Hammer\u2019s lethal master plan\u2013especially not the FedWorlds hero who so humiliated them on the battlefield.

He\u0027s hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, and like many kids with AS, Jacob has a special focus on one subject -- in his case, forensic analysis. He\u0027s always showing up at crime scenes, thanks to the police scanner he keeps in his room, and telling the cops what they need to do...and he\u0027s usually right. But then his town is rocked by a terrible murder and, for a change, the police come to Jacob with questions. All of the hallmark behaviors of Asperger\u0027s -- not looking someone in the eye, stimulatory tics and twitches, flat affect -- can look a lot like guilt to law enforcement personnel. Suddenly, Jacob and his family, who only want to fit in, feel the spotlight shining directly on them. For his mother, Emma, it\u0027s a brutal reminder of the intolerance and misunderstanding that always threaten her family. For his brother, Theo, it\u0027s another indication of why nothing is normal because of Jacob. And over this small family the soul-searing question looms: Did Jacob commit murder? Emotionally powerful from beginning to end, *House Rules* looks at what it means to be different in our society, how autism affects a family, and how our legal system works well for people who communicate a certain way -- and fails those who don\u0027t.

Time-travel, however, \n\n           has become acceptable to science fiction readers \n\n           as a traditional device in stories than are \n\n           otherwise admissible in the genre. Here, Frederik \n\n           Pohl employs it to portray the amusingly \n\n           catastrophic meeting of three societies.*** \n\nexcerpt from the introductory: I - Foraminifera 9 \n\nPaptaste udderly, semped sempsemp dezhavoo, qued schmerz-Excuse me. I mean to say that it was like an endless diet of days, boring, tedious.... \n\nNo, it loses too much in the translation. Explete my reasons, I say. Do my reasons matter? No, not to you, for you are troglodytes, knowing nothing of causes, understanding only acts. Acts and facts, I will give you acts and facts. \n\nFirst you must know how I am called. My \u0022name\u0022 is Foraminifera 9-Hart Bailey\u0027s Beam, and I am of adequate age and size. (If you doubt this, I am prepared to fight.) Once the-the tediety of life, as you might say, had made itself clear to me, there were, of course, only two alternatives. I do not like to die, so that possibility was out; and the remaining alternative was flight. \n\nNaturally, the necessary machinery was available to me. I arrogated a small viewing machine, and scanned the centuries of the past in the hope that a sanctuary might reveal itself to my aching eyes. Kwel tediety that was! Back, back I went through the ages. Back to the Century of the Dog, back to the Age of the Crippled Men. I found no time better than my own. Back and back I peered, back as far as the Numbered Years. The Twenty-Eighth Century was boredom unendurable, the Twenty-Sixth a morass of dullness. Twenty-Fifth, Twenty-Fourth-wherever I looked, tediety was what I found. \n\n \n\nI snapped off the machine and considered. Put the problem thus: Was there in all of the pages of history no age in which a 9-Hart Bailey\u0027s Beam might find adventure and excitement? There had to be! It was not possible, I told myself, despairing, that from the dawn of the dreaming primates until my own time there was no era at all in which I could be-happy? Yes, I suppose happiness is what I was looking for. But where was it? In my viewer, I had fifty centuries or more to look back upon. And that was, I decreed, the trouble; I could spend my life staring into the viewer, and yet never discover the time that was right for me. There were simply too many eras to choose from. It was like an enormous library in which there must, there had to be, contained the one fact I was looking for-that, lacking an index, I might wear my life away and never find. \n\n\u0022*Index!*\u0022\n\n",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nWhen I was fourteen, a cousin of mine angered a Malignant One. It was a big case, a genuine scandal. Maybe you remember it. At the time, when it ended, I just wanted to forget about the whole thing. But a couple of years have passed and I guess maybe it\u0027s time to think about it again. Thus begins Ellen Pierson\u0027s story of how she helped her cousin Paul contend with the Malignant One running a temp agency in the office building where he worked. Ellen\u0027s story is a bright and moving tale set in the same fabulous, fantastic America as that of Rachel Pollack\u0027s award-winning Unquenchable Fire. Funny and frantic, poignant and powerful, Temporary Agency is an enduring fable from a writer whose work, in the words of Orson Scott Card, \u0022like a river in flood, resists the well-channeled ways, cutting its own channel through the fictional terrain.\u0022",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nFor generations, treasure hunters have tried to unlock the deadly puzzle known as the Water Pit: a labyrinth of shafts and tunnels that honeycombs the heart of a small island off the coast of Maine. Reputed to be the hiding place of pirate treasure, the Water Pit possesses an inexplicable ability to kill those who venture into it, from professionals to innocent explorers. But now one man has made a startling discovery: The Water Pit is actually a carefully designed fortress, conceived for pirates by a renowned seventeenth-century architect who hid his plans in code. Unlocking the code will break the curse of the Water Pit. Or will it? The most comprehensive, high-tech expedition ever assembled has come to Maine and to Dr. Malin Hatch, owner of the island. While the treasure hunters have their reasons for mounting this assault--$2 billion in gold--Hatch has his own motives to join them. For Hatch, whose brother died on Ragged Island thirty years before, the only escape from the curse is through the black swirling waters and bloodstained chambers of the Pit. With more computing power than a small university, the recovery team slowly chips away at the mystery. But as the seekers try to conquer the Pit, men begin to die. Hatch is confronted with his childhood memories of the tragedy even as he is drawn into a complex relationship with a beautiful French diver. All the while, the last, secret chamber of the Pit waits to unleash the most lethal mystery of all. . . .A thriller of the highest order, Riptide is an extraordinary novel of obsession, courage, and adventure. With each nerve-racking page we are swept into the mystery and the challenge of Ragged Island and forced to face the haunting question: Is the Water Pit a gateway to limitless treasure--or to hell itself?",

I\u0027ve heard it said that God made all men, but Samuel Colt made all men equal. We\u0027d see what Mr. Colt could do for a woman. Jack Gabert went to India to serve his Queen. He returned to London a violently changed man, infected with an unnatural sickness that altered his body and warped his mind. Eileen Callaghan left an Irish convent with a revolver and a secret. She knows everything and nothing about Jack\u0027s curse, but she cannot rest until he\u0027s caught. His soul cannot be saved. It can only be returned to God. In the years following the American Civil War, the nun and unnatural creature stalk one another across the United States. Their dangerous game of cat and mouse leads them along great rivers, across dusty plains, and into the no man\u0027s land of the unmarked western territories. Here are three tales of the hunt. Reader, take this volume and follow these tormented souls. Learn what you can from their struggle\u0027s against each other, against God, and against themselves.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nTHE SEPARATION is the story of twin brothers. Rowers in the 1936 Olympics, they meet Rudolf Hess, Hitler\u0027s deputy; one joins the RAF, and captains a Wellington; he is shot down after a bombing raid on Hamburg and become\u0027s Churchill\u0027s aide-de-camp; his twin brother, a pacifist, works with the Red Cross, rescuing bombing victims in London. But this is not a straightforward story of the Second World War: this is an alternate history: the two brothers - both called J.L. Sawyer - live their lives in alternate versions of reality. In one, the Second World War ends as we imagine it did; in the other, thanks to efforts of an eminent team of negotiators headed by Hess, the war ends in 1941. THE SEPARATION is an emotionally riveting story of how ordinary people can make a difference; it\u0027s a savage critique of Winston Churchill, the man credited as the saviour of Britain and the Western World, and it\u0027s a story of how one perceives and shapes the past. THE SEPARATION was originally published by Simon \u0026 Schuster as a trade paperback, with a very small print run; it went out of print almost immediately and was never reprinted. Gollancz will publish initially as a price-promoted hardcover, as a platform for reviews and national newspaper coverage, prior to lead title paperback publication in 2004.",

    "Description": "\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn December of 2011, I gave a talk to an audience of scientists, Pentagon officials, politicians, and CEOs on the secret of life and how I\u0027d figured it out the previous summer. Afterwards, people came up individually and told me how much what I\u0027d shared meant to them. This book is based on the truth I spoke about. It\u0027s something I learned from within myself, something I believed saved me. And more than that, the way I set about to do it. This is a collection of thoughts on what I learned, what worked, what didn\u0027t. Where I succeed and importantly, where I fail daily. The truth is to love yourself with the same intensity you would use to pull yourself up if you were hanging off a cliff with your fingers. As if your life depended upon it. Once you get going, it\u0027s not hard to do. Just takes commitment and I\u0027ll share how I did it. It\u0027s been transformative for me. I know it will be transformative for you as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EAbout the Author\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been fortunate enough to have some amazing experiences in my life so far. I\u0027ve trekked to one of the highest base camps in the Himalayas, meditated with Tibetan monks in the Dalai Lama\u0027s monastery, earned my US Army Infantry patch, walked 550 miles across Spain, lived in Paris, been the only non-black, non-woman member of the Black Women\u0027s writers\u0027 group, written a novel, held the hands of dying patients, and worked with some of the best people in Silicon Valley. But the most transformative experience has been the simple act of loving myself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E",

She sent them out into the galaxy to observe and document the rise and fall of countless human empires. Since then, every two hundred thousand years, they gather to exchange news and memories of their travels. Only this millennium there is no gathering. Someone is eliminating the Gentian line. And Campion and Purslane\u2014two shatterlings who have fallen in love and shared forbidden experiences\u2014 must determine exactly who, or what, their enemy is, before they are wiped out of existence.",

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nWhen a man has a great deal of knowledge, it becomes extremely easy for him to confuse \u0022knowledge\u0022 with \u0022wisdom\u0022 ... and forget that the antonym of \u0022wisdom\u0022 is not \u0022ignorant\u0022 but \u0022folly.\u0022 Forward: Hardly had man solved his basic problems on the planet of his origin than he began to jumble into space. Barely a century had elapsed in the exploration of the Solar System than he began to grope for the stars.And suddenly, with an all but religious zeal, mankind conceived its fantasy dream of populating the galaxy, Never in the history of the race had fervor reached such a peak and held so long. The question of why was seemingly ignored. Millions of Earth-t)pe planets beckoned and with a lemming-like desperation humanity erupted into them. \n\n \n\nBut the obstacles were frightening in their magnitude. The planets and satellites of Sol had proven comparatively tractable and those that were suited to man-life were quickly brought under his dominion. But there, of course, he had the advantage of proximity. The time involved in running back and forth to the home planet was meaningless and all Earth\u0027s resources could be thrown into each problem\u0027s solving. \n\nBut a planet a year removed in transportation or even communication? Ay! this was another thing and more than once a million colonists were lost before the Earthlings could adapt to new climates, new flora and fauna, new bacteria-or to factors which the most far out visionary had never fancied, perhaps the lack of something never before missed. \n\nSo, mad with the lust to seed the universe with his kind, men sought new methods. To a hundred thousand worlds they sent smaller colonies, as few as a hundred pioneers apiece, and there marooned them, to adapt, if adapt they could. \n\nFor a millennium each colony was left to its own resources, to conquer the environment or to perish in the effort. \n\nA thousand years was sufficient. Invariably it was found, on those planets where human life survived at all, man slipped back during his first two or three centuries into a state of barbarism. Then slowly began to inch forward again. There were exceptions and the progress on one planet never exactly duplicated that on another, however the average ivas surprisingly close to both nadir and zenith, in terms of evolution of society. \n\nIn a thousand years it was deemed by the Office of Galactic Colonization such pioneers had largely adjusted to the new environment and were ready for civilization, industrialization and eventual assimilation into the rapidly evolving Galactic Commonwealth.\n\n",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nIn the latest installment of The Vampire Chronicles, Anne Rice summons up dazzling worlds to bring us the story of Armand--eternally young, with the face of a Botticelli angel. Armand, who first appeared in all his dark glory more than twenty years ago in the now-classicInterview with the Vampire, the first of The Vampire Chronicles, the novel that established its author worldwide as a magnificent storyteller and creator of magical realms. Now, we go with Armand across the centuries to the Kiev Rus of his boyhood--a ruined city under Mongol dominion--and to ancient Constantinople, where Tartar raiders sell him into slavery. And in a magnificent palazzo in the Venice of the Renaissance we see him emotionally and intellectually in thrall to the great vampire Marius, who masquerades among humankind as a mysterious, reclusive painter and who will bestow upon Armand the gift of vampiric blood. As the novel races to its climax, moving through scenes of luxury and elegance, of ambush, fire, and devil worship to nineteenth-century Paris and today\u0027s New Orleans, we see its eternally vulnerable and romantic hero forced to choose between his twilight immortality and the salvation of his immortal soul.",

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nReturning to the hypnotic world she so brilliantly created in **Interview with the Vampire**, Anne Rice demonstrates once again her power to enthrall.  With the same richness of drama, atmosphere and incident, she tells the fantastic story of the vampire Lestat, whom we first perceived as the seductive devil-vampire of **Interview with the Vampire** and whom we now follow through the ages as he searches for the origin and meaning of his own dark immortality.  And who, more and more, engages our sympathy until he stands revealed as a questing romantic, a vampire-hero with his own strange and passionate courage and morality.As the novel opens, Lestat, having risen from the earth after a fifty-five years\u0027 sleep,  and infatuated with the modern world, presents himself in all his vampire brilliance as a rock star, a superstar, a seducer of millions.  And, in this blaze of adulation, daring to break the vampire oath of silence, he determines to tell his story, to rouse the generations of the living dead from their slumbers and to penetrate the riddle of his own existence.As he speaks we are plunged back into eighteenth-century France, into the castle where we meet the young Lestat: child of impoverished aristocrats, heroic hunter of wolves, at odds with his tyrannical father, running away to join a traveling troupe of actors.  We see him in the licentious Paris of the day, first apprentice at a boulevard theater, then its most celebrated actor, idolized, adored by many and--night after night--watched by one . . . until, in a sleep filled with dreams of the wolves he killed as a boy, he is shocked awake by a dark figure and suddenly, horribly, eternally joined to the unholy brotherhood.We follow Lestat as he searches for others like him--in churches and brothels, in gambling houses, huts and palaces--sometimes joined by the vampire-angel Gabrielle, who is bound to him both by blood and by passion; sometimes traveling with his adored Nicolas, the violinist whose music and beauty are equally transcendent.  We follow Lestat as he travels from the snowcapped mountains of the Auvergne and the primeval forest of ancient Gaul to Sicily, Istanbul, Venice and Cairo, searching for his origins, sometimes finding clues to the birth of the vampire race, knowing always that the central truth eludes him.But all the while, throughout his travels, through many lands and many times, Lestat has made enemies among his brethren--vampires who are in terror of his questions, who fear he will disturb the uneasy balance in which they exist with the mortal world, and who suspect in him a desire to rule.  And when, in the caves below a craggy Greek island, in a sanctuary whose walls are covered with gold-flecked murals, the very first of the living dead awake, the truth at the heart of his quest is at last revealed.  Ancient forces held immobile through the ages are irreversibly set in motion, and as the novel rushes to its stunning climax, Lestat\u0027s vampire foes converge in pursuit of him on the demonic freeways of the twentieth century.",

Welcome to Blackwood Farm: soaring white columns, spacious drawing rooms, bright, sun-drenched gardens, and a dark strip of the dense Sugar Devil Swamp. This is the world of Quinn Blackwood, a brilliant young man haunted since birth by a mysterious doppelg\u00E4nger, \u201CGoblin,\u201D a spirit from a dream world that Quinn can\u2019t escape and that prevents him from belonging anywhere. When Quinn is made a Vampire, losing all that is rightfully his and gaining an unwanted immortality, his doppelg\u00E4nger becomes even more vampiric and terrifying than Quinn himself. As the novel moves backwards and forwards in time, from Quinn\u2019s boyhood on Blackwood Farm to present day New Orleans, from ancient Athens to 19th-century Naples, Quinn seeks out the legendary Vampire Lestat in the hope of freeing himself from the spectre that draws him inexorably back to Sugar Devil Swamp and the explosive secrets it holds. A story of youth and promise, of loss and the search for love, of secrets and destiny, Blackwood Farm is Anne Rice at her mesmerizing best. From the Hardcover edition.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nAn ever-expanding subgenre of science fiction is devoted to \u0022alternate worlds\u0022 or \u0022alternate histories\u0022: fiction in which a crucial event goes differently than in the world we know, and history is changed. Keith Roberts\u0027s Pavane (1968) is set in a backward 20th century molded by the assassination of Queen Elizabeth I and the triumph of a militantly antiscience Catholic Church. This is a classic alternate history, in the same company as such highly regarded novels as L. Sprague De Camp\u0027s seminal Lest Darkness Fall (1941), in which a modern man slips back in time and attempts to avert the Dark Ages; Ward Moore\u0027s Bring the Jubilee (1953), set after the South wins the U.S. Civil War; and Philip K. Dick\u0027s The Man in the High Castle (1962), set after the Germans and Japanese win World War II. Lest Darkness Fall and The Man in the High Castle are justly famous; the other two classics, Bring the Jubilee and Pavane, are less well known, and that is a shame. One reason for Pavane\u0027s relative obscurity among American SF readers might be its British setting and author (the Moore and Dick novels are both set in the U.S., and De Camp, Moore, and Dick were all American). Another reason might be that Pavane is a novel created from interrelated but standalone stories (six \u0022measures,\u0022 or novelettes, and a coda), and the stories are of varying quality. Most are wise, beautifully written, and intensely visualized, especially the opener, \u0022The Lady Margaret,\u0022 and the closer, \u0022Corfe Gate\u0022; but \u0022Brother John,\u0022 the story of the monk-artist who witnesses Inquisition tortures and sparks an anti-Church rebellion, is far less detailed, and sometimes even unclear. Another reason for the novel\u0027s obscurity may be that some of the stories/chapters have more of a fantasy feel than is typical of more recent alternate history. Also, the nature of the coda\u0027s revelations may put off some readers. Nonetheless, Pavane is an intelligent, powerful, and moving work, deserving of a wide readership. --Cynthia Ward",

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nAfter the shattering death of his beloved wife, aging baby-boomer Russell Walker had wanted only to hide from the world in the woods of British Columbia. Instead, an old college acquaintance called Smelly, who was a telepath, had knocked on his door and demanded his help in stopping a serial killer who made Hannibal Lector look like a boy scout. They had managed to convince Nika, a hard-headed and skeptical police officer, and the trio had stopped the killer, though nearly at the cost of their own lives, and things could go back to normal . . . they thought. \n\n  \n\nBut then Russell was visited by his estranged son, Jesse, a PR exec from New York, still angry over his father\u2019s role in his mother\u2019s death. And, to their dismay, Nika and Russell learn that agreeing to help Zudie conceal the fact that he can read minds involves committing to help him hide from the CIA, who have been hunting him desperately ever since he escaped from the MK Ultra Project back in the 60s. Constable Nika must decide what being a peace officer means. Russell must decide on the fly whether or not Smelly is the kind of friend you\u0027d die for. And Jesse, who lives in America, must decide just where his own national--and personal--loyalties lie. \n\n  \n\nBest-selling and award-winning author of *The Martian Child* **David Gerrold** says of *Very Hard Choices*, \u201CSpider Robinson is at his best when he is most passionate\u2014and this is Spider Robinson at his very best. If you\u0027re expecting a nice polite distraction that you can put down and forget, you\u0027re going to be very annoyed. This isn\u0027t a story, it\u0027s a wake-up call. And it isn\u0027t over until you decide it\u0027s over.\u201D\n\n",

    "Description": "\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGretchen Rubin had an epiphany one rainy afternoon in the unlikeliest of places: a city bus. \u0022The days are long, but the years are short,\u0022 she realized. \u0022Time is passing, and I\u0027m not focusing enough on the things that really matter.\u0022 In that moment, she decided to dedicate a year to her happiness project. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this lively and compelling account, Rubin chronicles her adventures during the twelve months she spent test-driving the wisdom of the ages, current scientific research, and lessons from popular culture about how to be happier. Among other things, she found that novelty and challenge are powerful sources of happiness; that money can help buy happiness, when spent wisely; that outer order contributes to inner calm; and that the very smallest of changes can make the biggest difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFrom Publishers Weekly\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EStarred Review\u003C/b\u003E. Rubin is not an unhappy woman: she has a loving husband, two great kids and a writing career in New York City. Still, she could-and, arguably, should-be happier. Thus, her methodical (and bizarre) happiness project: spend one year achieving careful, measurable goals in different areas of life (marriage, work, parenting, self-fulfillment) and build on them cumulatively, using concrete steps (such as, in January, going to bed earlier, exercising better, getting organized, and \u0022acting more energetic\u0022). By December, she\u0027s striving bemusedly to keep increasing happiness in every aspect of her life. The outcome is good, not perfect (in accordance with one of her \u0022Secrets of Adulthood\u0022: \u0022Don\u0027t let the perfect be the enemy of the good\u0022), but Rubin\u0027s funny, perceptive account is both inspirational and forgiving, and sprinkled with just enough wise tips, concrete advice and timely research (including all those other recent books on happiness) to qualify as self-help. Defying self-help expectations, however, Rubin writes with keen senses of self and narrative, balancing the personal and the universal with a light touch. Rubin\u0027s project makes curiously compulsive reading, which is enough to make any reader happy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EReview\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CAn enlightening, laugh-aloud read. . . . Filled with open, honest glimpses into [Rubin\u2019s] real life, woven together with constant doses of humor.\u201D (Terry Hong, Christian Science Monitor )\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CFor those who generally loathe the self-help genre, Rubin\u2019s book is a breath of peppermint-scented air. Well-researched and sharply written. . . . Rubin takes an orderly, methodical approach to forging her own path to a happier state of mind.\u201D (Kim Crow, Cleveland Plain Dealer )\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CPractical and never preachy . . . the rare self-help tome that doesn\u2019t feel shameful to read.\u201D (Daily Beast )\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201CPacked with fascinating facts about the science of happiness and rich examples of how she improves her life through changes small and big The Happiness Project made me happier by just reading it.\u201D (Amy Scribner, Bookpage ) \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E",

They\u2019re young, they\u2019re fast and strong, and they\u2019re totally without normal human qualms.\n\n\n\nThe universe is a dangerous place for humanity\u2014and it\u0027s about to become far more dangerous. Three races that humans have clashed with before have allied to halt our expansion into space. Their linchpin: the turncoat military scientist Charles Boutin, who knows the CDF\u2019s biggest military secrets. To prevail, the CDF must find out why Boutin did what he did.\n\n \n\nJared Dirac is the only human who can provide answers -- a superhuman hybrid, created from Boutin\u0027s DNA, Jared\u2019s brain should be able to access Boutin\u0027s electronic memories. But when the memory transplant appears to fail, Jared is given to the Ghost Brigades.\n\n \n\nAt first, Jared is a perfect soldier, but as Boutin\u2019s memories slowly surface, Jared begins to intuit the reason\u2019s for Boutin\u2019s betrayal. As Jared desperately hunts for his \u0022father,\u0022 he must also come to grips with his own choices.

His pursuit of his father\u0027s past--haunted by voodoo, adultery and murder--takes him to a place called Hayti, once the most prosperous black community in the South.  Now the mysteries of Michael\u0027s own heritage become a matter of life and death, as racial conflicts barely restrained since the 1960s erupt again.    Rooted in the true story of the US government\u0027s urban renewal policy and its disastrous aftermath, Black \u0026 White is a literary thriller, a family saga, and a searing portrait of institutionalized hatred.    \u0022A stunning tapestry that captures the hopes, dreams, greed, bigotry, ambitions and betrayals that shaped [the characters\u0027] destinies and those of our country.\u0022  --Publishers Weekly\n\n",

Now he offers us a superb quintet of novellas -- five dazzling masterworks of speculative fiction, including \u0022Orphans of the Helix,\u0022 his award-winning return to the Hyperion Universe -- that demonstrates the unique mastery, breathtaking invention, and flawless craftsmanship of one of contemporary fiction\u0027s true greats. \n\nHuman colonists seeking something other than godhood encounter their long-lost \u0022cousins\u0022...and an ancient scourge.\n\n A devastated man in suicide\u0027s embrace is caught up in a bizarre cat-and-mouse game with a young woman possessing a world-ending power.\n\n The distant descendants of a once-oppressed people learn a chilling lesson about the persistence of the past.\n\n A terrifying ascent up the frigid, snow-swept slopes of K2 shatters preconceptions and reveals the true natures of four climbers, one of whom is not human.\n\n At the intersection of a grand past and a threadbare present, an aging American in Russia confronts his own mortality as he glimpses a wondrous future.\n\n",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nOn June 9, 1865, while traveling by train to London with his secret mistress, 53-year-old Charles Dickens--at the height of his powers and popularity, the most famous and successful novelist in the world and perhaps in the history of the world--hurtled into a disaster that changed his life forever. Did Dickens begin living a dark double life after the accident? Were his nightly forays into the worst slums of London and his deepening obsession with corpses, crypts, murder, opium dens, the use of lime pits to dissolve bodies, and a hidden subterranean London mere research . . . or something more terrifying? Just as he did in The Terror, Dan Simmons draws impeccably from history to create a gloriously engaging and terrifying narrative. Based on the historical details of Charles Dickens\u0027s life and narrated by Wilkie Collins (Dickens\u0027s friend, frequent collaborator, and Salieri-style secret rival), DROOD explores the still-unsolved mysteries of the famous author\u0027s last years and may provide the key to Dickens\u0027s final, unfinished work: The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Chilling, haunting, and utterly original, DROOD is Dan Simmons at his powerful best.",

An intelligent microbe race that can live symbiotically in other intelligent beings is colonizing the human race throughout the civilized universe.  And each colony of microbes has its own personality, good or bad. In some people, carriers, they are brain enhancers, and in others a fatal brain plague, a living addiction. This is the story of one woman\u0027s psychological and moral struggle to adjust to having an ambitious colony of microbes living permanently in her own head. This novel is one of the most powerful and involving SF novels of the year.\n\n",

The Underpeople, humanlike beings created from animals to do the work of utopia, had no rights, and could be disposed of at the whim of a human. But they had become more humanlike than their creators, and their leader, the cat woman C\u00BFMell, had a plan for gaining their freedom\u00BFwhich made her much too dangerous a person to be permitted to live. Elsewhere in the galaxy, the planet Norstrilia had power of its own, for it was the only source of stroon, the drug which arrested aging and made humans immortal. Its inhabitants were wealthy beyond comprehension, and one of them, a boy named Rod McBan, with the help of his computer, had manipulated the galactic economy until he completely owned the planet Earth\u00BFwhich made him much too dangerous a person to be permitted to live. But when Rod came to Earth and joined forces with C\u00BFMell and the Underpeople, the petrified utopia of the Instrumentality began to crack and fall apart as freedom was reborn in the galaxy. . . .",

On the outbound journey, automatic sensors drop their ship -- the Perseus -- into normal space for an encounter with a mysterious skeletal object. The encounter leaves them baffled, and leads them to a view an epic space battle. But strange as that is, it\u0027s nowhere near as mysterious as finding a planet covered in radioactive fuel ore -- and populated with humanoid robots who have been expecting their arrival and greet them as returning masters. . . !",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nFor young Mark, the world has turned as bleak and gray as the Brighton winter. Separated from his real father and home in London, he\u0027s come to live with his mother and her new husband in an old house near the sea. He spends his days alone, trying to master the skateboard, while other boys his age are in school. He hates the unwanted stepfather who barged into Mark\u0027s life to rob him of joy. Worst of all, his once-vibrant mother has grown listless and weary, no longer interested in anything beyond her sitting room.   But on a damp and chilly evening, an accident carries Mark into the basement flat of the old woman who lives at the bottom of his stepfather\u0027s house. She offers tea, cakes, and sympathy . . . and the key to a secret, bygone world. Mark becomes caught up in the frenetic bustle of the human machinery that once ran a home, and drawn ever deeper into a lost realm of spirits and memory. Here below the suffocating truths, beneath the pain and unhappiness, he finds an escape, and quite possibly a way to change everything.   A richly evocative, poignantly beautiful modern-day ghost story, The Servants marks the triumphant return of Michael Marshall Smith\u2014the first novel in a decade from the multiple award-winning author of Spares.",

When a former colleague tries to steal the invention, not only the future of Dr. Seaton and his allies, but ultimately the entire world hangs in the balance! The first of the great \u0022space opera\u0022 science fiction novels, The Skylark of Space remains a thrilling tale more than 80 years after its creation.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nOne of the most fascinating mysteries of the heavens is the comet. It goes through space, gets near enough to the earth to be seen, and then goes off and disappears in celestial distance. Often it has a hyperbolic orbit, which would make it impossible to come back. Yet it may return -- apparently contradicting the geometry of conic sections. This only goes to prove once more that it is risky to say anything is impossible. . . . A good many of us who are now certain beyond a doubt that space travel will forever remain in the realm of the impossible, probably would, if a rocket that were shot to the moon, for instance, did arrive, and perhaps return to give proof of its safe arrival on our satellite, accept the phenomenon in a perfectly blas, twentieth century manner. Dr. Smith, that phenomenal writer of classic scientific fiction, seems to have become so thoroughly convinced of the advent of interplanetary travel that it is difficult for the reader to feel, after finishing \u0022Spacehounds of IPC,\u0022 that travel in the great spaces is not already an established fact. Dr. Smith, as a professional chemist, is kept fairly busy. As a writer, he is satisfied with nothing less than perfection. For that reason, a masterpiece from his pen has become almost an annual event. We know you will like \u0022Spacehounds\u0022 even better than the \u0022Skylark\u0022 series.",

Mostly well-reasoned examination and partial rant, Stephenson\u0027s In the Beginning... was the Command Line is a thoughtful, irreverent, hilarious treatise on the cyber-culture past and present; on operating system tyrannies and downloaded popular revolutions; on the Internet, Disney World, Big Bangs, not to mention the meaning of life itself.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nFrom the opening line of his breakthrough cyberpunk novel Snow Crash, Neal Stephenson plunges the reader into a not-too-distant future. It is a world where the Mafia controls pizza delivery, the United States exists as a patchwork of corporate-franchise city-states, and the Internet--incarnate as the Metaverse--looks something like last year\u0027s hype would lead you to believe it should. Enter Hiro Protagonist--hacker, samurai swordsman, and pizza-delivery driver. When his best friend fries his brain on a new designer drug called Snow Crash and his beautiful, brainy ex-girlfriend asks for his help, what\u0027s a guy with a name like that to do? He rushes to the rescue. A breakneck-paced 21st-century novel, Snow Crash interweaves everything from Sumerian myth to visions of a postmodern civilization on the brink of collapse. Faster than the speed of television and a whole lot more fun, Snow Crash is the portrayal of a future that is bizarre enough to be plausible.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nWith this extraordinary first volume in what promises to be an epoch-making masterpiece, Neal Stephenson hacks into the secret histories of nations and the private obsessions of men, decrypting with dazzling virtuosity the forces that shaped this century.In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy\u0027s fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces.Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse\u0027s crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a \u0022data haven\u0022 in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe\u0027s tough-as-nails grandaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi sumarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn.A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson\u0027s most accomplished and affecting work to date, CRYPTONOMICON is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day-after-tomorrow. It is a work of great art, thought, and creative daring; the product of a truly icon",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nIt\u0027s the year 2044, and America has gone to hell. A disenfranchised U.S. Air Force base has turned to highway robbery in order to pay the bills. Vast chunks of the population live nomadic lives fueled by cheap transportation and even cheaper computer power. Warfare has shifted from the battlefield to the global networks, and China holds the information edge over all comers. Global warming is raising sea level, which in turn is drowning coastal cities. And the U.S. government has become nearly meaningless. This is the world that Oscar Valparaiso would have been born into, if he\u0027d actually been born instead of being grown in vitro by black market baby dealers. Oscar\u0027s bizarre genetic history (even he\u0027s not sure how much of him is actually human) hasn\u0027t prevented him from running one of the most successful senatorial races in history, getting his man elected by a whopping majority. But Oscar has put himself out of a job, since he\u0027d only be a liability to his boss in Washington due to his problematic background. Instead, Oscar finds himself shuffled off to the Collaboratory, a Big Science pork barrel project that\u0027s run half by corruption and half by scientific breakthroughs. At first it seems to be a lose-lose proposition for Oscar, but soon he has his \u0022krewe\u0022 whipped into shape and ready to take control of events. Now if only he can straighten out his love life and solve a worldwide crisis that no one else knows exists. --Craig E. Engler",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nAlongside William Gibson and Neal Stephenson, Bruce Sterling stands at the forefront of a select group of writers whose pitch-perfect grasp of the cultural and scientific zeitgeist endows their works of speculative near-future fiction with uncanny verisimilitude. To read a novel by Sterling is to receive a dispatch from a time traveler. Now, with The Caryatids, Sterling has written a stunning testament of faith in the power of human intellect, creativity, and spirit to overcome any obstacle\u2013even the obstacles we carry inside ourselves. The world of 2060 is divided into three spheres of influence, each fighting with the others over the resources of fallen nations and an environment degraded almost to the point of no return. There is the Dispensation, centered in Los Angeles, where entertainment and capitalism have fused with the highest of high-tech. There is the Acquis, a Green-centered collective that uses invasive neurological technology to create a networked utopia. And there is China, the sole surviving nation-state, a dinosaur that has prospered only by pitilessly pruning its own population. Products of this monstrous world, the daughters of a monstrous mother, and\u2013according to some\u2013monsters themselves, are the Caryatids: the four surviving female clones of a mad Balkan genius and wanted war criminal now ensconced, safely beyond extradition, on an orbiting space station. Radmila is a Dispensation star determined to forget her past by building a glittering, impregnable future. Vera is an Acquis functionary dedicated to reclaiming their home, the Croatian island of Mljet, from catastrophic pollution. Sonja is a medical specialist in China renowned for selflessly risking herself to help others. And Biserka is a one-woman terrorist network. The four \u201Csisters\u201D are united only by their hatred for their \u201Cmother\u201D\u2013and for one another. When evidence surfaces of a coming environmental cataclysm, the Dispensation sends its greatest statesman\u2013or salesman\u2013John Montgomery Montalban, husband of Radmila, and lover of Vera and Sonja, to gather the Caryatids together in an audacious plan to save the world.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nLike his peers William Gibson and Neal Stephenson, bestselling author Bruce Sterling writes cutting-edge speculative fiction firmly rooted in today\u2019s reality. Now inThe Zenith Angle, he has created a timely thriller about an information-age security expert caught up in America\u2019s escalating war on terror. Infowar. Cybercombat. Digital security and techno-terror. It\u2019s how nations and networks secretly battle, now and into the future. And for Derek \u201CVan\u201D Vandeveer, pioneering computer wizard, a new cyberwarrior career begins on the fateful date of September 11, 2001. Happily married with a new baby, pulling down mind-blowing money as a VP of research and development for a booming Internet company, Van has been living extralarge. Then the devastating attacks on America change everything. And Van must decide if he\u2019s willing to use the talents that built his perfect world in order to defend it. \u201CIt\u2019s our networks versus their death cult,\u201D says the government operative who recruits Van as the key member of an ultraelite federal computer-security team. In a matter of days, Van has traded his cushy life inside the dot-com bubble for the labyrinthine trenches of the Washington intelligence community\u2014where rival agencies must grudgingly abandon decades of distrust and infighting to join forces against chilling new threats. Van\u2019s special genius is needed to make the country\u2019s defense systems hacker-proof. And if he makes headway there, he\u2019ll find himself troubleshooting ultrasecret spy satellites. America\u2019s most powerful and crucial \u201Ceye in the sky,\u201D the KH-13 satellite\u2014capable of detecting terrorist hotbeds worldwide with pinpoint accuracy\u2014is perilously close to becoming an orbiting billion-dollar boondoggle, unless Van can debug the glitch that\u2019s knocked it out of commission. Little does he suspect that the problem has nothing at all to do with software . . . and that what\u2019s really wrong with the KH-13 will force Van to make the unlikely leap from scientist to spy, team up with a ruthlessly resourceful ex\u2013Special Forces commando, and root out an unknown enemy . . . one with access to an undreamed of weapon of untold destructive power.",

Stirling\u2019s *The Sky People*, aliens terraformed Mars (and Venus) two hundred million years ago, seeding them with life-forms from Earth. Humans didn\u2019t suspect this until the twentieth century, but when the first probes landed on our sister worlds, and found life\u2014intelligent life, at that\u2014things changed with a vengeance. By the year 2000, America, Russia, and the other great powers of Earth are all contending for influence and power amid the newly-discovered inhabitants of our sister planets. \n\n \n\nVenus is a primitive world. But on Mars, early hominids evolved civilization earlier than their earthly cousins, driven by the needs of a harsh world growing still harsher as the initial terraforming runs down. Without coal, oil, or uranium, their technology was forced into different paths, and the genetic wizardry of the Crimson Dynasty united a world for more than twenty thousand years. \n\n \n\nNow, in a new stand-alone adventure set in this world\u2019s 2000 AD, Jeremy Wainman is an archaeologist who has achieved a lifelong dream; to travel to Mars and explore the dead cities of the Deep Beyond, searching for the secrets of the Kings Beneath the Mountain and the fallen empire they ruled. \n\n \n\nTeyud Zha-Zhalt is the Martian mercenary the Terrans hire as guide and captain of the landship Intrepid Traveller. A secret links her to the deadly intrigues of Dvor il-Adazar, the City That Is A Mountain, where the last aging descendant of the Tollamune Emperors clings to the remnants of his power\u2026and secrets that may trace their origin to the enigmatic Ancients, the Lords of Creation who reshaped the Solar System in the time of the dinosaurs. \n\n \n\nWhen these three meet, the foundations of reality will be shaken\u2014from the lost city of Rema-Dza to the courts of the Crimson Kings.\n\n",

Period.\u0022* \n\n *William O\u0027Brien, former director of cybersecurity and communications systems policy at the White House **\n\n\n\n 2009 saw one of the most inventive techno-thriller debuts in decades as Daniel Suarez introduced his terrifying and tantalizing vision of a new world order. *Daemon* captured the attention of the tech community, became a national bestseller, garnered attention from futurists, literary critics, and the halls of government-leaving readers clamoring for the conclusion to Suarez\u0027s epic story. \n\n\n\n In the opening chapters of *Freedom(tm)*, the Daemon is well on its way toward firm control of the modern world, using an expanded network of real-world, dispossessed darknet operatives to tear apart civilization and rebuild it anew. Civil war breaks out in the American Midwest, with the mainstream media stoking public fear in the face of this \u0027Corn Rebellion\u0027. Former detective Pete Sebeck, now the Daemon\u0027s most famous and most reluctant operative, must lead a small band of enlightened humans in a populist movement designed to protect the new world order. \n\n\n\n But the private armies of global business are preparing to crush the Daemon once and for all. In a world of conflicted loyalties, rapidly diminishing government control, and a new choice between free will and the continuing comforts of ignorance, the stakes could not be higher: hanging in the balance is nothing less than democracy\u0027s last hope to survive the technology revolution.\n\n",

    "Description": "A BLACK SWAN is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.  Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don\u2019t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the \u201Cimpossible.\u201D  For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now, in this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don\u2019t know. He offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.  Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications, The Black Swan will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. The Black Swan is a landmark book\u2014itself a black swan.  Nassim Nicholas Taleb has devoted his life to immersing himself in problems of luck, uncertainty, probability, and knowledge. Part literary essayist, part empiricist, part no-nonsense mathematical trader, he is currently taking a break by serving as the Dean\u2019s Professor in the Sciences of Uncertainty at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. His last book, the bestseller Fooled by Randomness, has been published in twenty languages, Taleb lives mostly in New York.  ",

What Taleb has identified and calls \u201Cantifragile\u201D is that category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish.\u00A0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn \u003Cem\u003EThe Black Swan, \u003C/em\u003ETaleb showed us that highly improbable and unpredictable events underlie almost everything about our world. In \u003Cem\u003EAntifragile,\u003C/em\u003E Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, even necessary, and proposes that things be built in an antifragile manner. The antifragile is beyond the resilient or robust. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFurthermore, the antifragile is immune to prediction errors and protected from adverse events. Why is the city-state better than the nation-state, why is debt bad for you, and why is what we call \u201Cefficient\u201D not efficient at all? Why do government responses and social policies protect the strong and hurt the weak? Why should you write your resignation letter before even starting on the job? How did the sinking of the \u003Cem\u003ETitanic\u003C/em\u003E save lives? The book spans innovation by trial and error, life decisions, politics, urban planning, war, personal finance, economic systems, and medicine. And throughout, in addition to the street wisdom of Fat Tony of Brooklyn, the voices and recipes of ancient wisdom, from Roman, Greek, Semitic, and medieval sources, are loud and clear.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAntifragile\u003C/em\u003E is a blueprint for living in a Black Swan world.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EErudite, witty, and iconoclastic, Taleb\u2019s message is revolutionary: The antifragile, and only the antifragile, will make it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPraise for *Antifragile\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u201CTaleb takes on everything from the mistakes of modern architecture to the dangers of meddlesome doctors and how overrated formal education is. . . .

But when the tide in the war on terror suddenly turns against the U.S., the president has no choice but to secretly bring Harvath back inside. Ducking a congressional subpoena, Harvath travels to the Mediterranean, where he learns of a shadowy organization that has been combing the earth for decades in search of the ultimate weapon to use against the United States and her allies. Now, after three summers of record-setting heat across present-day Europe, one steadily melting Alpine glacier has given up an ancient secret--one with the potential to thrust civilization back into the Dark Ages.From Cyprus, London, and Paris, to Italy, Switzerland, and Saudi Arabia, Harvath must race against the clock to stop one of the greatest evils ever to face the United States. With his characteristic high-voltage action, sweeping international locales, and meticulous research, Brad Thor has created another supercharged novel that is sure to thrill.",

And a counterterrorism operative who will risk everything -- even treason -- to keep the people he loves alive.**\n\nBrad Thor, the *New York Times* bestselling author of *Takedown,* delivers an explosive international thriller featuring Navy SEAL turned Homeland Security operative Scot Harvath, who somewhere, somehow, has left the wrong person alive.\n\n\u0022Thou shalt not negotiate with terrorists...\u0022\n\n**Six months ago:** In the dead of the night, five of the most dangerous detainees in the war on terror are pulled from their isolation cells in Guantanamo Bay, held at gunpoint, and told to strip off their orange jumpsuits. Issued civilian clothes and driven to the base airfield, they are loaded aboard a Boeing 727 and set free.\n\n**Present day:** Covert counterterrorism agent Scot Harvath awakens to discover that his world has changed violently -- and forever. A sadistic assassin with a personal vendetta is wreaking havoc of biblical proportions. Unleashing nightmarish horrors on those closest to Harvath, the attacker thrusts everything Harvath holds dear -- including his life -- into absolute peril.\n\nOrdered by the president to stay out of the investigation, Harvath is forced to mount his own operation to uncover the conspiracy and to exact revenge. When he discovers a connection between the attacks and a group of prisoners secretly released from Guantanamo, Harvath must ask himself previously unthinkable questions about the organizations and the nation he has spent his life serving.\n\nA renegade from his own government, Harvath will place his life on the line as his search for the truth draws him into a showdown with one of the most dangerous men on the face of the earth.\n\nBrad Thor roars through this nonstop adventure full of international intrigue, twisted betrayals, and ultimate revenge.\n\n",

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nProject Orion. It\u0027s a revolutionary space-based defense shield, only weeks away from deployment. Promising global protection from missile attack by rogue nations, Orion offers an \u0022umbrella\u0022 of security to a terror-stricken world. But even the loftiest aims often conceal darker intentions. Behind closed doors, insiders maneuver to control the new superweapon with an agenda that places all mankind at risk.\n\nWhen Angela Browning, an ambitious journalist, receives a mysterious computer disk from an anonymous source, she can\u0027t believe the information it contains: photos of ancient structures on the planet Mars. But after diligent research, Angela discovers that the images originated from the Mars Observer probe, a satellite declared \u0022lost\u0022 over a decade before. Perhaps even more troubling than the artifacts themselves is the implication that somehow, somewhere in the corridors of power, it\u0027s been decided that the discovery of intelligent life on Mars must be suppressed.\n\nAngela\u0027s quest for the truth eventually leads her to Jake Deaver, the commander of the last Apollo mission to the moon. Deaver, a maverick his whole career, may be the only one who can help her shed light on a conspiracy that reaches into the darkest corners of Washington politics. But the pair\u0027s investigation takes them dangerously close to Project Orion, and a powerful cabal determined to prevent anyone from jeopardizing their plans. Now Jake and Angela must face the stark reality that pursuing the truth may put both their lives at risk. And the choice they make will change the world forever.",

Wehrmacht officer Hasso Pemsel, a career soldier on the losing end of the greatest war in history, flees from a sniper\u0027s bullet, finding himself hurled into a mysterious, fantastic world of wizards, dragons, and unicorns. There he allies himself with the blond-haired, blue-eyed Lenelli, and Velona, their goddess in human form, offering them his knowledge of warfare and weaponry in their genocidal struggle against a race of diminutive, swarthy barbarians known as Grenye. But soon, the savagery of the Lenelli begins to eat at Hasso Pemsel\u0027s soul, causing him to question everything he has long believed about race and Reich, right and wrong, Ubermenschen and Untermenschen. Hasso Pemsel will learn the difference between following orders... and following his conscience.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nHarry Turtledove\u2019s remarkable alternative history novels brilliantly remind us of how fragile the thread of time can be, and offer us a world of \u201Cwhat if.\u201D Drawing on a magnificent cast of characters that includes soldiers, generals, lovers, spies, and demagogues, Turtledove returns to an epic tale that only he could tell\u2013the story of a North American continent, separated into two bitterly opposed nations, that stands on the verge of exploding once again.In 1914 they called it The Great War, and few could imagine anything worse. For nearly three decades a peace forged in blood and fatigue has held sway in North America. Now, Japan dominates the Pacific, the Russian Tsar rules Alaska, and England, under Winston Churchill, chafes for a return to its former glory. But behind the fa\u00E7ade of world order, America is a bomb waiting to go off. Jake Featherston, the megalomaniacal leader of the Confederate States of America, is just the man to light the fuse. In the White House in Philadelphia, Socialist President Al Smith is a living symbol of hope for a nation that has been through the fires of war and the flood tides of depression. In the South, Featherston and his ruling Freedom Party have put down a Negro rebellion with a bloody fist and have interned them in concentration camps. Now they are determined to crush their Northern neighbor at any cost. Featherston\u2019s planes attack Philadelphia without warning. The U.S.A. lashes back blindly at Charleston. And a terrible second coming is at hand. When the CSA blitzkrieg is launched, the U.S.A. is caught flat-footed. Before long, the gray Army reaches Lake Erie. But in its wake the war machine is spinning a vortex of destruction, betrayal, and fury that no one, not even Jake Featherston himself, can control. Now, President Smith faces a Herculean task, while an obscure assistant secretary of war named Roosevelt rises in his ranks. For the U.S.A., the darkest days still lay ahead. Across the globe, a new era of war has just begun. And in the hands of the incomparable Harry Turtledove, readers are treated to a masterful vision of what might have been. An enduring portrait of history, nations, and human nature in its many manifestations, Return Engagement is a monumental journey into the second half of the twentieth century.From the Hardcover edition.",

Nobody worries too much about job satisfaction; if you haven\u0027t spent a lifetime learning the futility of fighting back, you wouldn\u0027t be a rifter in the first place.

In a claustrophobic setting enlivened by periodic flashes of beauty and terror, the crew of Beebe Station come across as not only believable but likeable as they fight for equilibrium against their own demons, one another, their superiors and their remorselessly hostile surroundings.\u0022\u0097***The New York Times***\n\n\u0022A powerful first novel . . . A savage, bitter, and often blackly comic vision of the near future . . . Watts has rendered a character whose emotional complexity demands our respect. . . . [The ending] is both startling and oddly satisfying in its earned nihilism. A terrific debut from an author we will be seeing again.\u0022\u0097***Edmonton Journal***\n\n\u0022Watts\u2019 true enemy is human stupidity, the sort of thing that turns children into walking disaster zones, treats adults as interchangeable things, insists that unchecked fertility is a Good Thing, and blindly trusts that our artificially intelligent creations must share our priorities. As Watts develops that point, he tells an absorbing tale set in a bizarre world and hinging upon intriguing technology. He\u0027s done his homework well, and it shows.\u0022\u0097***Analog***\n\n\u0022Burdened by exploding population, the world turns to geothermal energy from vents thousands of feet under the ocean. The vents are explosive and unpredictable, sending bursts of superheated steam randomly into a nightmare world of transparent fish, 50-foot tube worms, and oddly fragile sea monsters whose teeth shatter when they bite. To survive at such depths, the crews of deep-sea power plants must be modified to withstand the pressure, \u0091breathe\u2019 water, and see in a darkness illuminated only by phosphorescent creatures. The necessary mental modification isn\u0027t easily done; indeed, only the already emotionally damaged--battered women, paranoid ex-spies, child molesters\u0097won\u0027t turn psychotic from it. One crew\u2019s members struggle among themselves at first, but soon discover strange satisfaction in their isolated world and insight into their troubled lives. A subtle paranoia is everywhere, however, from the cramped station quarters to the office of the corporate psychiatrist who selected the crew. The hidden threat behind this unease isn\u0027t revealed until nearly the end, but the dark universe of the sea bottom and rich characterization captivate to the last page. Watts makes a brilliant debut with a novel that is part undersea adventure, part psychological thriller, and wholly original.\u0022\u0097**Roberta Johnson, *Booklist***\n\n\u0022Near/medium-future deep-sea endeavor, from a Toronto-resident newcomer. To tap the energy of ocean-floor hydrothermal vents, the powerful Grid Authority sets up a power station in the Juan de Fuca Rift west of Seattle. Humans, physically modified to be able to live and work underwater without the restrictions of diving equipment, will maintain the facility. Of these volunteers (sex criminals, psychopaths, wife-beaters, and child molesters: their alternative is brainwashing), some can\u0027t adapt to the crushing, claustrophobic environment. Others brim with suppressed violence. Gerry Fischer takes to eating the local wildlife and never returns to the station. Lenie Clarke suspects that all the members of the group have been deliberately mentally damaged so they won\u0027t want to leave. But the Rifters develop a telepathic awareness of each other\u0027s thoughts and feelings. On the surface, meanwhile, smart gels\u0097jelly-like intelligent neural networks\u0097run most of the equipment and are slated to replace the Rifters, who refuse to return to the surface. The Grid Authority learns that the Rifters, and all deep-water life-forms, harbor an archaic non-DNA microorganism, \u00DFehemoth, that would destroy all DNA-based life if it reached land. At the same time, Lenie discovers on the ocean floor a nuclear bomb operated by a smart gel; it will trigger a devastating earthquake should \u00DFehemoth escape. Problem is, nobody at the Grid Authority understands how the smart gels evaluate information. What if the gels prefer \u00DFehemoth to orthodox life-forms? . . . Fizzing with ideas, and glued together with dark psychological tensions: an exciting debut.\u0022\u0097***Kirkus Reviews***\n\n\u0022In the near future, energy comes from the geothermal waters of the deep ocean, but the cost of providing power for the surface has a price--the sanity of the physically modified humans (\u0022rifters\u0022) who live in an alien and dangerous environment. Watts\u0027s first novel elegantly captures the isolation and claustrophobia of the lightless ocean depths, smoothly blending psychological suspense with high-tech sf adventure. Large libraries should consider adding this to their sf collections.\u0022\u0097***Library Journal***\n\n\u0022Set in the early 21st century, Watts\u0027s debut describes a future when the search for energy leads to the tapping of geothermal sources deep in the ocean, as in the Pacific\u0027s Juan de Fuca Rift, near Canada\u0027s Northwest coast. The maintenance workers of the dangerous underwater power plants are selected for their psychotic tendencies, which enable them to forget their previous lives on dry land, and are then surgically altered to survive the intense pressure of the sea\u0027s abyssal depths. These changes, which render the workers amphibious, also leave them less than well equipped to face the threat of powerful, archaic bacterialike creatures that proliferate at the ocean bottom and use human hosts to carry them upward to dry land, where their superior DNA could render our species obsolete. The human resistance to these life forms is described with a great deal of explicit violence and graphic language, as well as well-orchestrated paranoia that recalls the classic SF tale \u0091Who Goes There?\u2019 Watts\u2019s characterizations aren\u0027t strong but, as in Arthur C. Clarke\u0027s *The Deep Range*, the underwater setting and the technology employed there function as characters in their own right, and quite vigorously. The novel\u0027s pacing is excellent, making this, overall, a good bet for beach reading.\u0022\u0097***Publishers Weekly***\n\n\u0022There are enough provocative ideas in *Starfish* to suggest that Watts does his homework and thinks things through, and enough skill at scene and dialogue writing to convince us that he\u0027s a fine craftsman\u0022\u0097**Gary K. Wolfe, *Locus***\n\n\u0022An interesting, entertaining, and, best of all, promising debut novel.\u0022\u0097**Don D\u2019Ammassa, *Science Fiction Chronicle***\n\n\u0022I read *Starfish* in several large gulps. The story drives like a futuristic locomotive. It\u0027s a hypnotic read, somber and compelling. Best thing I\u0027ve read in a long time. Peter Watts is an author to watch for.\u0022\u0097**Robert Sheckley**\n\n\u0022Peter Watts delivers\u0097solid, inventive hard SF about the deep sea, but as we\u0027ve never seen before. This moves like the wind.\u0022\u0097**Gregory Benford, author of *Cosm***\n\n\u0022With gritty action and realistic science, Peter Watts brings to life a dark and vivid world.\u0022\u0097**David Brin**\n\n\u0022Peter Watts bathes a gonzo, hopeless pessimism reminiscent of Philip K. Dick or Joanna Russ in the cold, edgy light of hard science fiction \u00E1 la Benford, Bear, or Tiptree. In Starfish, Watts creates in his protagonist a poetry of dysfunction which is angry and eerily redemptive, and which makes compelling, almost compulsive reading.\u0022\u0097**Jane Dorsey**",

This produces a map indicating the geographical point from which all the powers of the earth can be controlleda point located in Paris, France, at Foucaults Pendulum. But in a fateful turn the joke becomes all too real, and when occult groups, including Satanists, get wind of the Plan, they go so far as to kill one of the editors in their quest to gain control of the earth. Orchestrating these and other diverse characters into his multilayered semiotic adventure, Eco has created a superb cerebral entertainment.",

Such diverse technologies as computing, communications, genetics, biology, and nanotechnology are rapidly pushing humanity to a new singularity, a point at which all the rules change and everything we assume about what it means to be human may no longer apply. Leading science fiction writers such as Wil McCarthy, Esther Friesner, James P. Hogan, Hugo-winner David D. Levine, Dave Freer, Wen Spencer, Mark L. Van Name, and others explore this strangest of new frontiers. From a criminal given a last chance at life in a very new kind of existence to a man struggling to claim his own humanity, from battles in the depths of very strange spaces to an amazing new version of keeping up with the Joneses, the stories in Transhuman take you where no human has gone before--but where many of us might one day go.",

Their artificial intelligences were designed to make them selflessly serve and protect humans throughout the galaxy and made each Bolo the epitome of the knight sans peur et sans reproche, and often far more noble than the humans who gave them their orders. Now, David Weber, New York Times best-selling author of the Honor Harrington series, continues the history of the Bolo, in four short novels, one of them published here for the first time. One Bolo is driven over the edge by the very humans it is pledged to protect. Another Bolo must decide whether or not to disobey when it is given an order that constitutes genocide. A third must hunt one of its own kind whose robot brain is damaged and rescue two children which the deranged Bolo thinks it is protecting from a nonexistent enemy. And more, including as a bonus, David Weber\u0027s own authoritative technical history of the Bolo, all in a volume that will be irresistible both for David Weber\u0027s huge readership and Bolo fans everywhere.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nMultiple Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge takes readers on a fifty-million-year trip to a future where humanity\u0027s fate will be decided in a dangerous game of high-tech survival. In this taut thriller, a Hugo finalist for Best Novel, nobody knows why there are only three hundred humans left alive on the Earth fifty million years from now. Opinion is fiercely divided on whether to settle in and plant the seed of mankind anew, or to continue using high-energy stasis fields, or \u0022bobbles,\u0022 in venturing into the future. When somebody is murdered, it\u0027s obvious someone has a secret he or she is willing to kill to preserve.The murder intensifies the rift between the two factions, threatening the survival of the human race. It\u0027s up to 21st century detective Wil Brierson, the only cop left in the world, to find the culprit, a diabolical fiend whose lust for power could cause the utter extinction of man. Filled with excitement and adventure, Vinge\u0027s tense SF puzzler will satisfy readers with its sense of wonder and engaging characters, one of whom is a murderer with a unique modus operandi.",

The odds were against the Star Kingdom forces, and they had to run. But Michelle\u2019s ship was crippled, and had to be destroyed to prevent superior Manticoran technology from falling into Havenite hands, and she and her surviving crew were taken prisoner. Much to her surprise, she was repatriated to Manticore, carrying a request for a summit conference between the leaders of the two sides which might end the war. But a condition of her return was that she gave her parole not to fight against the forces of the Republic of Haven until she had been officially exchanged for a Havenite prisoner of war, so she was given a command far away from the war\u2019s battle lines. What she didn\u2019t realize was that she would find herself on a collision course, not with a hostile government, but with the interstellar syndicate of criminals known as Manpower. And Manpower had its own plans for eliminating Manticore as a possible threat to its lucrative slave trade, deadly plans which remain hidden in the shadows. \n\n  \n\n*Praise for the Prequel, *The Shadow of Saganami: \n\n\u201CThese hugely entertaining and clever adventures are the very epitome of space opera. . . .

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nFour time Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge has taken readers to the depths of space and into the far future in his bestselling novels *A Fire Upon the Deep* and *A Deepness in the Sky*. Now, he has written a science-fiction thriller set in a place and time as exciting and strange as any far-future world: San Diego, California, 2025.\n\n \n\nRobert Gu is a recovering Alzheimer\u0027s patient. The world that he remembers was much as we know it today. Now, as he regains his faculties through a cure developed during the years of his near-fatal decline, he discovers that the world has changed and so has his place in it. He was a world-renowned poet. Now he is seventy-five years old, though by a medical miracle he looks much younger, and he\u2019s starting over, for the first time unsure of his poetic gifts. Living with his son\u2019s family, he has no choice but to learn how to cope with a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum, layers of reality built on digital views seen by a single person or millions, depending on your choice. But the consensus reality of the digital world is available only if, like his thirteen-year-old granddaughter Miri, you know how to wear your wireless access\u0097through nodes designed into *smart* clothes\u0097and to see the digital context\u0097through *smart* contact lenses. \n\n \n\nWith knowledge comes risk. When Robert begins to re-train at Fairmont High, learning with other older people what is second nature to Miri and other teens at school, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination. \n\n \n\nIn a world where every computer chip has Homeland Security built-in, this conspiracy is something that baffles even the most sophisticated security analysts, including Robert\u2019s son and daughter-in law, two top people in the U.S. military. And even Miri, in her attempts to protect her grandfather, may be entangled in the plot. \n\n \n\nAs Robert becomes more deeply involved in conspiracy, he is shocked to learn of a radical change planned for the UCSD Geisel Library; all the books there, and worldwide, would cease to physically exist. He and his fellow re-trainees feel compelled to join protests against the change. With forces around the world converging on San Diego, both the conspiracy and the protest climax in a spectacular moment as unique and satisfying as it is unexpected. This is science fiction at its very best, by a master storyteller at his peak.                                                      \n\n**Vernor Vinge**, author of such acclaimed novels as *True Names*, *The Peace War*, *Marooned in Realtime*, *A Fire Upon the Deep*, and *A Deepness in the Sky*, has won four Hugo Awards. A mathematician and computer scientist, he lives in San Diego, California.                                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n**Winner of the Hugo Award**\n\nFour time Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge has taken readers to the depths of space and into the far future in his bestselling novels *A Fire Upon the Deep* and *A Deepness in the Sky*. Now, he has written a science-fiction thriller set in a place and time as exciting and strange as any far-future world: San Diego, California, 2025.\n\n\n\nRobert Gu is a recovering Alzheimer\u0027s patient, cured by modern medicine after years of a near-fatal decline. As he struggles to make his was in a much-changed world, where a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum has taken over the world, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination.\n\nWith one foot in the present, and the other one sliding into an uncertain future, Vinge offers a story of the potential joys and hazzards that accompany our rapidly changing relationship to technology and the world. This is science fiction at its very best, by a master storyteller at his peak.                                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\u0022In the near future, the European Center for Defense against Disease discovers a diabolical pseudomimivirus. Rather than set off a panic, secret agents of the EU, Japan, and India work clandestinely to uncover a conspiracy seemingly based in a San Diego lab. Former poet Robert Gu, a recovering Alzheimer\u0027s patient (one of the lucky few who took to all the treatments), returns to school just as agents Braun, Vaz, and Mitsuri put their wheels in motion. Immensely frustrated by simultaneously living with his son\u0027s family and completely reeducating himself, Gu becomes a perfect dupe for the hacker hired by the gang of spooks. Under cover of a library protest, Gu and some old friends get into the lab, trailed by one of Gu\u0027s adolescent classmates and his granddaughter. The conspiracy runs deep and has some terrifying implications on account of YGBM (you gotta believe me) technology, regardless of the conspirators\u0027 intentions. The near future is less alien here than in some of Vinge\u0027s other work, but no less fascinating and well constructed.\u0022\u0097**Regina Schroeder, *Booklist***\n\n\u0022Set in San Diego, Calif., this hard SF novel from Hugo-winner Vinge offers dazzling computer technology . . . Circa 2025, people use high-tech contact lenses to interface with computers in their clothes. \u0022Silent messaging\u0022 is so automatic that it feels like telepathy. Robert Gu, a talented Chinese-American poet, has missed much of this revolution due to Alzheimer\u0027s, but now the wonders of modern medicine have rehabilitated his mind. Installed in remedial classes at the local high school, he tries to adjust to this brave new world, but soon finds himself enmeshed in a somewhat quixotic plot by elderly former University of California-San Diego faculty members to protest the destruction of the university library, now rendered superfluous by the ubiquitous online databanks. Unbeknownst to Robert, he\u0027s also a pawn in a dark international conspiracy to perfect a deadly biological weapon.\u0022\u0097***Publishers Weekly***",

Encasing governmental installations and military bases in bobbles, the Authority becomes virtually omnipotent. But they\u0027ve never caught Paul Hoehler, the maverick who invented the technology, and who has been working quietly for decades to develop a way to defeat the Authority. With the help of an underground network of determined, independent scientists and a teenager who may be the apprentice genius he\u0027s needed for so long, he will shake the world, in the fast-paced hard-science thriller that garnered Vinge the first of his four Hugo nominations for best novel.",

Now he takes his masterful blend of military SF, espionage thriller, and dystopian cyberpunk one step further\u2014to the edge of annihilation . . . . Life as U.S. counterintelligence agent Claire Haskell once knew it is in tatters\u2014her mission betrayed, her lover dead, and her memories of the past suspect. Worse, the defeat of the mysterious insurgent group known as Autumn Rain was not as complete as many believed. It is quickly becoming clear that the group\u2019s ultimate goal is not simply to destroy the tenuous global alliances of the 22nd century\u2014but to rule all of humanity. And they\u2019re starting with the violent destruction of the Net and the assassination of the U.S. president. Now it\u2019s up to Claire, with her ability to jack her brain into the systems of the enemy, to win this impossible war.

Williams delivers a hard-hitting blend of military SF and dystopian cyberpunk, set in a futuristic landscape where hostilities rage from the Eastern and Western hemispheres to the outer ranges of space. In the 22nd century, the first wonder of a brave new world is the Phoenix Space Elevator, designed to give mankind greater access to the frontier beyond Earth. Built by the U.S./Pan-Asian Coalition, the Elevator is also a grand symbol of superpower alliance following a second cold war. And it\u2019s just been destroyed. The South American insurgent group Autumn Rain claims responsibility for the attack, but with suspicions rampant, armies and espionage teams are mobilized across the globe and beyond. Enter Claire Haskell and Jason Marlowe, U.S. counterintelligence agents, and former lovers\u2014though their memories may only be constructs implanted by their spymaster. Forced to set aside the enigma of their past, their agenda is to trust no one. For in a time of shifting loyalties, the enemy could be anyone\u2014from a shadowy assassin working a questionable mission on the dark side of the moon, to a Euro data thief working under deep cover and wooed into a dangerous pact. As the crisis mounts, and the search for Autumn Rain spans both Earth and Moon, the lives of all those involved will converge in one explosive finale\u2014and a startling aftermath that will rewrite everything they\u2019ve ever known\u2014about their mission, their world, and themselves",

And it might be\u2014for all the wrong reasons.                  Corporations on Freehold were eager to sell high-tech toys to the Ithkuil, as the inhabitants called themselves, which had the potential to disrupt their society. Then there was the U.N., which controlled the planet Earth. Earth and Freehold were not on good terms, to put it mildly, and the U.N. immediately sent its own ship to make contact with the Ithkuil. If the authoritarians from Earth started throwing their weight around, Freehold would have to push back, causing anything from a diplomatic incident to outright war. And then another ship arrived, full of idealistic do-gooders determined to keep the Ithkuil in their unspoiled state of nature . . .                  The whole thing was turning into a cross between a Marx Brothers farce and a Kafkaesque nightmare, with a potential for Greek tragedy. Contact with a more advance civilization might pose a danger to the Ithkuil, but it definitely was becoming more dangerous to the human factions, and the situation was a powder keg just waiting for a spark to cause a very deadly explosion. . . .",

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nIt starts with the dogs. They won\u0027t stop barking. And then the earth shrugs 8.9 on the Richter scale. It\u0027s the world\u0027s biggest earthquake since Lisbon in 1755, and it doesn\u0027t hit California or Japan or Mexico, but New Madrid, Missouri, a sleepy town on the Mississippi River. Seismologists had predicted the scope of the disaster . . . but no one listened.\n\nFor hundreds of miles around, dams burst, engulfing entire counties in tidal waves of mud and debris. Cities collapse into piles of brick and shards of glass. Hospitals and schools crumble. Bridges twist and snap, spilling rush-hour traffic into rivers already swollen with bodies. Within minutes, there is nothing but chaos and ruin from St. Louis to Vicksburg, from Kansas City to Louisville. Every bridge down, every highway torn, every house gone.\n\nAmerica\u0027s heartland has fallen into the nightmare known as the Rifta fault line in the earth that wrenchingly exposes the fractures in American society itself. As a strange white mist smelling of sulfur rises from the crevassed ground, the real terror begins for the survivors, who will soon envy the dead, including: \n\n Jason Adams, a teenager separated from his mother;\n\nNick Ruford, an African-American engineer searching for his estranged daughter; \n\n Noble Frankland, the TV preacher whose visions of hell have become all too real;\n\nLarry Hallock, a technician working frantically to prevent a nuclear meltdown at his power station;\n\nand Omar Paxton, a sheriff and Ku Klux Klansman who seeks racial vengeance in the turmoil of disaster.\n\n Walter J. Williams has created a modern American disaster saga, a story based on terrifying fact, filled with nonstop action, and peopled with characters who are heartbreakingly real. Witnessing authentic heroes surfacing in the unlikeliest places, you will share their horror, feel their despair, and triumph with them in their struggle to survive. One thing you will know for sure: It con happen here. And sooner or later, it will.\n\nA Disaster Waiting to Happen\n\nIt was the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who finally made the Swampeast habitable. Just south of Cape Girardeau the levee line began, to Continue 2,200 miles to the Gulf of Mexico. The levees kept the floodwaters Out. During the decades of prosperity, the farmers had forgotten the conditions under which they had prospered were artificial. Southeastern Missouri was as artificial as the Washington Monument, the St. Louis Gateway Arch, or the space shuttle, and like these, existed as a monument to the ingenuity of humankind. The land there had been manufactured.\n\nBut that which is artificial occupies a precarious position in the world of nature. Its existence depends upon the maintenance of the conditions under which it was designed. The Mississippi River\u0027s levee system was built with the understanding that two things would remain constant: The flood waters would not rise much higher than they had in the past, and the land on which the levees were built would not move of its own accord. The first of these constants was violated regularly. The result was a greater commitment to reinforced levees. The second constant, the requirement that the earth not move, had not been tested.\n\n*Though such a test, as history showed, was inevitable.*\n\n",

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nOne night in October when he was ten years old, Tyler Dupree stood in his back yard and watched the stars go out. They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier. He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout. It would shape their lives. \n\n\n\nThe effect is worldwide. The sun is now a featureless disk--a heat source, rather than an astronomical object. The moon is gone, but tides remain. Not only have the world\u2019s artificial satellites fallen out of orbit, their recovered remains are pitted and aged, as though they\u2019d been in space far longer than their known lifespans. As Tyler, Jason, and Diane grow up, a space probe reveals a bizarre truth: The barrier is artificial, generated by huge alien artifacts. Time is passing faster outside the barrier than inside--more than a hundred million years per year on Earth. At this rate, the death throes of the sun are only about forty years in our future. \n\n\n\nJason, now a promising young scientist, devotes his life to working against this slow-moving apocalypse. Diane throws herself into hedonism, marrying a sinister cult leader who\u2019s forged a new religion out of the fears of the masses.\n\n\n\nEarth sends terraforming machines to Mars to let the onrush of time do its work, turning the planet green. Next they send humans\u2026and immediately get back an emissary with thousands of years of stories to tell about the settling of Mars. Then Earth\u2019s probes reveal that an identical barrier has appeared around Mars. Jason, desperate, seeds near space with self-replicating machines that will scatter copies of themselves outward from the sun--and report back on what they find. \n\n\n\nLife on Earth is about to get much, much stranger.",

    "Description": "\u003Cp\u003EWhy do some people lead happy successful lives whilst other face repeated failure and sadness?  Why do some find their perfect partner whilst others stagger from one broken relationship to the next?  What enables some people to have successful careers whilst others find themselves trapped in jobs they detest?  And can unlucky people do anything to improve their luck - and lives? Ten years ago, Professor Richard Wiseman decided to search for the elusive luck factor by investigating the actual beliefs and experiences of lucky and unlucky people.  The results reveal a radical new way of looking at luck.  In this book, Wiseman identifies the four simple behavioural techniques that have been scientifically proven to help you attract good fortune.  He then shows how you can use these methods to revolutionise every area of your life - including your relationships, personal finances and career.",

    "Description": "SUMMARY:\nYou\u0027ve gotta love to hate the 1977 movie Damnation Alley, a cheese-filled classic from sci-fi\u0027s cinematic canon. But there\u0027s at least one good thing you can say about this otherwise awful flick: it\u0027s prevented the movie\u0027s far superior source material from being forgotten. Roger Zelazny\u0027s post-apocalypse novel predates the George Peppard-Jan-Michael Vincent vehicle by about a decade and represents the fine storytelling talents of one of science fiction and fantasy\u0027s most daring writers (likely best remembered for his imaginative Amber series). Speaking of vehicles: the coolest part of the movie--and likely, thankfully, the only part most people remember--turns out to be even cooler in the book: the flame-spewing, .50-caliber-bullet-belching, grenade-throwing, gigantic all-terrain vehicle that\u0027s responsible for getting a crucial antiserum shipment from Los Angeles to Boston to stop a deadly plague. The driver, a despicable lowlife named Hell Tanner, has been given a not-so-difficult choice. He can either get the drugs to the East Coast intact, save humanity, and receive a full pardon for his crimes, or he can refuse and spend the rest of his life in a \u0022zebra suit.\u0022 So what\u0027s the catch? Thanks to World War III, Middle America is now an electrical-storm-torn, heavily irradiated playground for dino-sized Gila monsters, \u0022freak spiders,\u0022 humongous bats \u0022that eat off the mutie fruit trees down Mexico way,\u0022 and 120-foot-long snakes as big around as garbage cans. And the native humans still scrambling around the wasteland aren\u0027t much less dangerous. Damnation Alley might not be Zelazny\u0027s best, but for reading on, say, a road trip, you can\u0027t do much better. Throw in some \u002760s-style, freak-out closing riffs, and a trip down the Alley becomes pretty hard to pass up. --Paul Hughes",

    "Description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\n*Vision of the Future* is the second book in the epic two-volume series *The Hand of Thrawn* from Timothy Zahn, the bestselling, Hugo Award-winning author of the original landmark trilogy based on George Lucas\u0027s legendary Star Wars(r) films. Now the story begun in *Specter of the Past* comes to an explosive conclusion as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo are thrust into the middle of an impending civil war--and discover the shocking truth behind the rumored resurrection of the dead Admiral Thrawn.\n\nFor a beleaguered Empire, desperate times call for desperate measures. Sowing discord among the fragile coalition of the New Republic, remnants of the once powerful Empire make one last play for victory. Having implicated the Bothans in an act of genocide, they now plan an attack on Han and Leia that is also to be blamed on the Bothans. If they are successful, the New Republic will be torn asunder. To prevent inevitable disaster, Luke, Leia, Han, and their friends must prove the Bothans innocent and reveal the Empire\u0027s treachery. But time is running out.\n\nThe cunning Major Tierce has joined with the ambitious Moff Disra in the Empire\u0027s master plan. At its heart lies the most elaborate con of all: the rumor that the legendary Grand Admiral Thrawn, long believed dead, has returned to lead the Empire to a prophesied triumph. The news of Thrawn\u0027s return is already rallying Empire forces against the New Republic.\n\nAs Leia travels to a secret rendezvous with an Imperial commander who claims towant peace, Han and Lando Calrissian journey into enemy territory to learn the truth of Emberlene\u0027s destruction. Meanwhile, Luke and Mara Jade infiltrate a hidden fortress where Thrawn\u0027s most fanatical followers await his call to arms. And Talon Karrde returns to his underworld past and a brutal crime lord whose knowledge may save the Republic. But it is the truth about Thrawn that is most important. In his hands--alive or dead--rests the fate of the New Republic.\n\n*Vision of the Future* is the magnificent finale to one of the most suspenseful, action-packed, and thought-provoking Star Wars(r) stories yet. It is a masterful re-creation that captures the magic and adventure of the greatest science fiction saga of all time.\n\n",

Against all odds they had succeeded , sharing their prize with the Terran Democratic Empire\u0027s erstwhile Chryselli allies, who were themselves the current focus of Ryqril aggression. Lathe had followed that by successfully entering Earth\u0027s last mountain war-era fortress and found a small resistance movement\u0027s final project: a drug called Whiplash, which could break the supposedly unbreakable Ryqril loyalty-conditioning. Now they face their most serious challenge. On one of the conquered human colony worlds is a Ryqril tactical center through which flows an entire sector\u0027s worth of military data. If the blackcollars can find a way inside, it could tip the balance in the current Ryqril-Chryselli war. It could even start humanity on the path back to ultimate freedom. But the Ryqril aren\u0027t sitting idly by. Under threat of reprisals against his world, Prefect Jamus Galway of Plinry is already on the case. His plan: to turn the blackcollars and their combat skill into unknowing tools of the Ryqril. His hidden ace: a clone duplicate of Lathe\u0027s ally Allan Caine, ready to be slipped into Lathe\u0027s inner circle. It will be the blackcollars\u0027 most important mission. It may also be their last.",
